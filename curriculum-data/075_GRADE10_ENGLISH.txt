**The Princess And The Pea**

[Box: What do you think this story is going to be about?]

**A. Now read the first paragraph to see if any of your predictions were right.**

Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to get married, 'But,' he said, 'my bride must be a real princess and she must be absolutely perfect. There were not many perfect princesses available. So, he left his comfortable palace and travelled everywhere on his horse looking for a real princess. But there was something wrong with every one of them: one was too stupid, one was too clever; one was too big and another was too small; one hit him and broke his jaw. The prince went back home very unhappy.

[Box: What do you think will happen now?]

Read the paragraph: were you right?

One night there was a great storm with thunder and lightning and the rain poured down. There was a knock at the palace gate. The King took his sword and went to the gate. There was a very attractive girl outside. She had the longest hair he had ever seen. She was cold and wet. She said, 'I - I - I am a princess.'

[Box: Guess what happens next]

---

**[Page 7]**

The king took her in and gave her some tea and dry clothes. The queen prepared a bed for her. She got twenty mattresses and twenty pillows. Then she took a pea and put it on the bed, and laid the mattresses and feather pillows on top. The princess had supper and climbed up a ladder into the bed, exhausted.

[Image: A sketch of a very high bed with a ladder next to it. A person is climbing the ladder.]

Next morning the queen went to see her. 'Did you sleep well, my dear?' she asked. 'No, very badly. There was something very hard in the bed and now I'm bruised all over.' The Queen was pleased to hear this. She knew this was a real princess because princesses have very delicate skins. The prince was glad too.

He married the princess and they lived happily ever after. They put the pea in the museum and everyone came to see it.

[Image: A sketch of several round, thatched-roof huts in a circle.]

[Box: Who builds each part of the house?]

1- Hello. My name is Adam. i live at Maleet in Darfur. Our houses are very simple. Each room stands on its own. The women build the lower part of the room, which is made of mud. The men build the upper part which is made of strong and long sticks of bambo. The rooms are cool in summer and warm in winter. The roofs are sloping so that the rain water runs away easily.

[Box: Why does Ohaj use a tent?]

[Image: A sketch of a person next to a tent in a desert-like landscape.]

---

**[Page 11]**

2- Hello, I'm Ohaj. I come from a village near Aroma in eastern Sudan. Our houses are simple and easy to build. We use tents which are made of wool. Tents are easy to erect and dismantle. This is helpful because my family breeds camels and we move from one place to another to find grazing for the camels. Our camels provide us with wool for the tents. Our tents are strong enough to protect us from the rain, the cold and the long summer heat.

[Box: What are the walls made of?]
[Box: And what are the roofs made of?]

3- Hello. I'm Dut Mabor. I come from Yirol in southern Sudan. My house looks like Adam's house. The rooms are separate. The round walls are built with mud and the roof is made of dry grass. The women help the men in building the house. They decorate the roof with colourful grass. This style of house is very suitable for our rainy climate.

It rains heavily in the south for at least seven months a year. So rain water runs easily off the roof. In the hot summer it is cool and comfortable.

[Box: How many rooms are there in Mohammed's house?]

**City Life (1)**

**A. Read the following text.**

Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, is one of the fastest growing cities in Africa. It is also a very exciting modern city. Like most modern cities it is very crowded, suffers a lot from pollution and traffic congestion but has many places of interest for tourism.

Nairobi is full of people doing different kinds of work. Some are employed in the motorcar industries where parts of the cars are imported and the factories in Nairobi assemble them. Many people also work in the tourism industry. They work as guides and in the hotels and restaurants.

Other interesting places to visit are the parliament buildings and the famous conference centre. The conference centre is one of Nairobi's tallest buildings. To get to the top, you have to use a lift.

[Image: A sketch of a tall, cylindrical skyscraper.]

The Animal orphanage, on the outskirts of the city, is also an interesting place to visit. Many injured animals and birds are brought here to recover before being returned to the national parks.

If you are tired of walking about in the city, there is usually a place where you can sit and rest. Telecommunications are very efficient in Nairobi and there are plenty of public telephones in hotels and in the streets which you can use to phone home.

**Pollution**

**A. Do you know what a pesticide is?**

Read the following passage and then answer the question:

[Box: Where did Ahmed live?]

Ahmed was nine years old and lived with his family in a village in Gezira. He was part of a large family of six brothers and five sisters. Ahmed looked after the family sheep. He always made sure they had the best grass to eat. He was very proud of his flock of sheep. They were very fat and healthy, and gave lots of milk for his all family.

[Box: What did the farmers spray on the crops?]

In the Gezira region farmers grow cotton and wheat. One year, however, the crops were attacked by lots of hungry insects. The farmers were very worried and sprayed their crops with a pesticide. This was hard expensive work. But the pesticide was very strong and killed most of the insects. The crops grew well and the farmers were happy. The next year the farmers had to spray their crops again because some of the insects which had not been killed had multiplied and were attacking the crops again. The farmers had to use more pesticide this time, but they killed most of the insects. The crops soon looked good again.

[Box: Where did Ahmed take his sheep for grazing?]

After the crops had been harvested, the fields were very good grazing land. Ahmed always made sure his sheep went into the best fields. These were the fields which had been sprayed with pesticide and the sheep ate a lot of grass.

---

**[Page 28]**

[Box: What happened to the sheep?]

Soon the sheep began to grow thin and did not produce much milk as they used to. The lambs did not play any more. Ahmed did not understand why the sheep were ill. He always took them to fields with green grass. Ahmed did not know that the green grass was covered in pesticide and the pesticide was making these sheep ill.

[Box: What poisoned the sheep and Ahmed's family?]

At the end of the year many of the sheep had died and some of Ahmed's brothers and sisters were also ill because they had drunk the milk from the sheep. The family was very sad, but they did not know that the pesticide was the poison.

**Organs of Speech**

**A. Read the following text and label the diagram below:**

The organs of speech include the following:
- The tongue
- The lips
- The teeth
- The lungs
- The roof of the mouth
- The glottis
- The nose

Speech is created by pushing air from the lungs through the glottis and out of the mouth or nose.

Speech sounds are often described by saying which organs of speech are used in the control of the flow of air from the lungs. For example, if the air is stopped at the glottis which is at the bottom of the throat, then it is called a glottal sound. If the air is stopped by the tongue and teeth, it is called a dental sound. If the air passes through the nose, it is called a nasal sound.

**Organs of speech**

Jenny: I'd love to. When is it?
Halima: Well, we had the religious ceremony three weeks ago, but the celebrations will begin on Wednesday and end early on Friday morning.
Jenny: Two days! Our weddings take less than one day. We have short official ceremony in a church or in a registry office. After that we have a party.
Halima: We will begin with a 'henna' party on Wednesday evening. Come to our house in the morning. We will put henna on your hands. Please come!
Jenny: I'd love to. What about Thursday? What happens then?

---

**[Page 55]**

Halima: Well, first of all the bridegroom's family will gather together then come to our house for supper. They will come in a bus and several cars. They will sing and clap and beat drums. After that, the bride and groom will go to the photographer's to have their pictures taken. Finally, at about eight o'clock the party will begin. What about your parties? Do you dance and sing?
Jenny: Well, we usually just dance. After the official ceremony we have a meal in a restaurant or a hotel. Then we have a party until about eleven o'clock. The photographer comes to the wedding to take photographs of the bride and bridegroom and their families. The bride and groom leave at the end of the party to begin their honeymoon.

**Read the conversation and say whether this statement is true or false.**

[Box: Jenny already knows Zeinab's mother-in-law.]

Jenny: This food is delicious. Who pays for all of these celebrations?
Saeeda: The bridegroom's family. They also give the bride's family a dowry, and also a lot of presents.
Jenny: In Britain it's the opposite. The bride's parents pay for the wedding and the groom's parents usually give the couple money or something for their house.
Saeeda: Have you said congratulations to the bride and groom?
Jenny: Yes, Zeinab is a beautiful bride. Do they sit in these chairs all night?
Saeeda: No. They often get up and dance. The bride is wearing a white dress now, but later she will change into a traditional Sudanese wedding dress and tobe.

---

**[Page 58]**

Jenny: Is every wedding like this?
Saeeda: No. Some people only have a religious ceremony. Also different tribes have their own customs. Christians usually have a religious ceremony in the Church then a party on the same day.
Jenny: There are differences in Britain as well. In England, the bride throws flowers into the air. People say that the person who catches them will get married next. In Scotland, the bride's father throws coins out of the window of the car as it leaves the Church. Children come and gather the coins.
Saeeda: If they did that here, the coins would be buried in the sand.
Jenny: Yes. Who is that lady in the green floral tobe?
Saeeda: That's the mother of the groom.
Jenny: So that's Zeinab's mother-in-law. Where is Zeinab's brother-in-law?
Saeeda: He's over there in front of the band talking to the singer. I'll introduce you to him.
Jenny: Oh, thank you. That would be great.

**Lesson 6**
**Loch Ness**

**A. Read the passage then answer this question.**
[Box: Does everyone believe in the monster?]

Inverness is a town in Scotland, the country where David lives. It is quite a large town near a very large lake. The Scottish word for a lake is "loch".

Loch Ness is famous because many people believe that a monster lives in the loch. It looks like a huge fish and can only be seen very early in the morning.
Some people have taken photographs of the monster, but usually there is not enough light for the photographs to be clear.

Some people think it is just a part of a tree or a boat or a large number of fish swimming together under the water.

The people, who believe in the monster say that thousands of years ago there were huge lakes in Scotland where large creatures could swim. Then some of the water disappeared and the creatures were trapped in the loch. They are still alive now because the loch is very deep and wide although some people say there is not enough food for the monster to eat.

David and Sulieman got up very early to catch the bus to Atbara. They are going to visit Karima, and Sulieman's cousin Khalid is going with them. Khalid lives in Atbara.

They got on the bus at 5 a.m. and it left at 5:30 a.m. The bus went very fast along the Tarmac road past El Jaili and on to Wad Bannaga where they got off the bus and had breakfast. Sulieman ordered ful beans.

"There's not enough salt in my beans," he said and went off to find some. David went to wash his hands. When the boys came back, there was no food on their table. "Oh, when you left, the waiter took it away," said one of the passengers.

"Hurry up," said the driver. The bus leaves in two minutes. They got on the bus again and travelled towards Shendi. After that the tarmac road ended and the bus rolled through the desert. David thought the bus was like a boat! He thought the driver was very clever because there are no signposts in the desert, but the driver did not get lost.

David noticed the pyramids but there was not enough time to stop and visit them. They reached Atbara at 1 p.m. and then got off the bus. David's face was brown because of the dust!

**Journey to Karima (2)**

**A. Read quickly and answer:**
[Box: How many times did the bus stop?]

The bus to Karima left Atbara at 6 a.m.
It was full of people and David was afraid the ferry from Atbara to El Fadlab would sink!
From Atbara to Karima there is no tarmac road only very sandy desert. David was glad he was sitting between two fat people and he did not roll around much! Sulieman said David looked like a sardine!

After 3 hours, the bus stopped and everyone got off. The driver had brought some special pancakes made of flour and crushed dates for the passengers to eat. David thought they were delicious. They got on the bus and set off again, but after one hour there was a thick sandstorm and the bus got stuck in the sand. A passenger got off the bus and put a piece of metal under the wheels. Some other people pushed the bus and it started again.

David could only see the faces of the people in front of him and nothing else. What a brave and clever driver!

They arrived in Karima about 9 p.m. The driver was very kind and took the boys to their grandfather's house. Grandfather was delighted to see them and asked David all about the journey.

3. Which birds do you see during the winter season?
4. Are there many birds in autumn in your area? Why? Why not?

---

**[Page 105]**

**C. Read the following section by section in order to answer the question:**

[Box: What is migration?]
You must have noticed that birds in the Sudan come and go. When they fly from one place to another, we say that birds migrate. Their migration is studied by scientists all over the world.

[Box: Why do birds migrate?]
Many birds migrate so as to avoid the cold weather. In this way they are able to live in warmer countries all the year round. Moreover, migration helps them to have a continuous supply of food. In some areas in the North and South Poles the water is frozen and snow covers everything. Therefore, food becomes scarce and birds migrate.

[Box: How do birds migrate?]
Scientists study the migration of birds. They have discovered that birds fly long distances, thousands of kilometers. When they migrate, they follow the same routes. They actually do this without training. In other words migrating birds follow these routes becasue they have a certain instinct. It has also been observed that birds migrate in flocks.

[Box: When do birds migrate?]
Birds choose the right time for migration. They start their journey when the sky is clear and there is almost no wind. Birds usually prefer to travel at night. They use the stars and the moon to help them find their way. However, if the weather is not suitable for migration, they land, rest and feed. Then they start their journey again when the weather conditions improve.

---

**[Page 106]**

[Box: How do scientists cooperate with each other?]
When a scientist in one country catches a migrating bird, he puts a metal ring on its leg. A scientist in another country finds the bird and the metal ring tells him where the bird has migrated from.
New inventions like radar and satellites help scientists as well as other interested people to study the migration of birds.
Birds are wonderful creatures, are't they?

**D. Read the whole text again to answer the following questions.**
1. What kind of climate do birds like?
2. What does the word scarce in paragraph 2 mean?
3. Who trains birds to migrate?
4. What does the word instinct mean?
5. Can a bird migrate by itself?
6. Make a list of all the facts you have found amazing about birds.

I sat the Sudan Shool Certificate examination in 1943 and got excellent results. In July of the same year I entered the School of Medicine, Gordon Memorial College in Khartoum. From 1949 to 1956 I worked in different parts of the Sudan such as Omdurman, Juba, Kassala and Halfa. In 1956 I was sent to Scotland to specialise in eye surgery.

**Lesson 7**
**Changes for the Better?**

**A. Read the following carefully to answer the question.**
[Box: What is the writer talking about?]

Fifty years ago people in the Sudan travelled on donkeys, cows, camels and other animals.
Today they travel by bus, lorry and plane. In the next century people will travel by spaceship. About one hundred years ago, the Sudanese did not have electricity, but today they have electricity and in the future they will generate much more electricity. A long time ago there were no schools but today there are different types of shools and after some time the computer will be used to help teachers teach as well as to help learners learn. In the past pigeons were used to carry letters from one place to another. Now people use the postal services and the telephone and soon they will use special telephones where you can see the person you are talking to. For millions of years people walked and ran on the earth, but now spacemen walk in space. What will they do in the twenty-first century? Can you guess? Our world is constantly changing, isn't it?

**Lesson 3**
**The Lion, The Hyena and the Fox**

**A. Read this story section by seciton and answer the questions.**
[Box: How did the animals plan to get their food?]

The lion, the Hyena and the Fox were neighbours. Each of them was living with his children near a big forest where they hunted for food.
One day the lion said to the Hyena and the Fox, "Let's go tomorrow morning to hunt. It's better for the three of us to hunt together, instead of each of us hunting alone."
But the Fox said to the lion: "Tell me, what shall we do with the animals that we kill?"
"We shall collect all of them and put them in one place. In the evening we shall divide them up equally so that each one of us takes his share of meat to his house," said the Lion.

[Box: Why was the Lion happy?]

Early next morning, the three friends went to hunt as they had agreed. First they killed a big buffalo and left it near the river. At midday, they killed a buck and put it beside the buffalo. Finally they killed a fat gazelle. The three friends sat down to rest near the river before they divided up the animals.
After their rest, the lion asked the hyena to divide up the three animals. The hyena agreed and said, "Give the buffalo to the lion, I will take the buck and the fox will take the fat gazelle".
The Lion became very angry and he hit the hyena very hard on the head and said:
"I don't agree with that!"
The lion ordered the fox to divide up the meat for the three of them.
The fox said to the lion, "The solution is very clear. Take the buffalo for your supper tonight, take the gazelle for your breakfast tomorrow morning, and take the buck for your lunch. The hyena and myself will get our share next time." The lion became very happy and smiled and said,
"My dear friend, how did you become so wise?"
"I learn from experience," the fox replied.

The lion sat beside the river eating the meat and the fox and the Hyena returned home hungry.

| 2. Mariam | | |
| 3. Ali | | |
| 4. Musa | | |

My name is Nawal. I want to tell you what each person does in our house. Of course I have one sister and two brothers. My father and mother have taught us the habit of doing things in our house by ourselves. We do not have servants, so each one of us knows exactly what he or she should do everyday.

I always help my mother with the cooking and also I do the washing up after meals. Generally, my mother wants the utensils in the kitchen to look clean and put in their proper places. I like reading and doing my homework after making the kitchen tidy. Watching T.V. is not my hobby, although I sometimes watch special programmes.

[Image: A person washing dishes.]

My sister Mariam likes cleaning the house. She does this every morning before going to school. Mariam likes reading but does not like watching T.V. She also enjoys mending clothes and sewing during her leisure time.

[Image: A person sweeping.]

My elder brother, Ali, likes reading. He helps our father in gardening and in doing small repair jobs around our house. He does not like watching TV and he does not like playing games, as well.

[Image: Two people gardening.]

My younger brother Musa is the opposite of Ali. He is very lazy and likes sleeping during his free time. He likes playing and doesn't like reading.

**The Weather in Northern Sudan**

**A. Read this passage carefully and answer the questions.**
[Box: Which are the coldest months in the Northern States?]

December, January and Febraury are the coldest months in the northern states. Occasionally the temperature drops to as low as 10º Centigrade(C) or even less. However, it's always wonderfully clear, bright and sunny at this time of the year. Sometimes it becomes misty in the morning and the mist disappears during the day. The air is often dry in spite of the cold northern winds, but it never snows in the Sudan.

[Box: When is the temperature very hot?]

In April, May and June, the weather becomes extremely hot. During these months, the temperature rarely drops to less than 35°C. There are usually strong winds full of dust at this time of the year. Sand-storms are also common during these months. Planes are often not able to land or take off in Atbara, Marowe and Dongoloa, especially in the afternoons. Also car drivers are often not able to drive their cars because they can not see the roads.

---

**[Page 149]**

[Box: When does it rain in the Northen State?]

The weather improves during the months of July, August and September. This is because the cold breeze blowing from the south makes the air cooler.

**Christmas**

**A. Read the dialogue and answer the questions.**
[Box: Find one thing about Christmas which is the same in Britain and Sudan.]

[Image: Three people sitting around a dinner table.]

Micheal Jonhson is a teacher in Malakal Secodary School and he is British. He was invited by Mr. Natale Ogilo, the headmaster, for Christmas dinner. They ate the Sudanese local foods, and after the meal the two friends discussed how Christmas is celebrated in the Sudan and in Britain. Here are some of the points which they discussed.

Natale: I am sure Mr. Johnson you have seen how we have prepared for the Christmas celebrations today. Can you tell me what you do in Britain?
Micheal: In Britain, some people start preparing special pudding as early as September. Many housewives make cakes at home, others buy ready-made cakes from the shops. Streets are decorated by the beginning of December and the shops display Christmas presents. Christmas cards are sent to relatives and friends ten days before Christmas day and that is the time when Christmas trees are put in the gardens and in the house.
Natal: As you have seen here in Malakal, people started making clothes for themselves and their children as early as October. This is because we do not have many ready-made clothes in the shops. The streets are not decorated except the church compounds. We do not have Christmas trees, but we use the wood cross like the one you see on the wall instead. Women make their cakes in the houses and no one buys in the shops. We also send Christmas cards to relatives and friends one month before Christmas.
Michael: I enjoyed your Christmas food very much, I ate chicken and a lot of meat but I have not seen the Christmas turkey. Don't you eat turkey here?
Natal: No, only some people in other places like Khartoum know about Turkey. We have nothing here.
Michael: In Britain some people go for special church service at midnight, and most of them go for the Christmas service by day. Is this the same here?
Natal: Yes, we do the same here, except that the youth go to the church while marching and singing.
Michael: What do you do after Christmas dinner? In Britain the evenings are spent playing games, singing and watching T.V.
Natal: We do not watch the T.V. but there will be singing and playing in the evening, especially the children. Now we shall go to watch our traditional dances in the public squares. The dance will continue until late in the night.
Michael: Thank you very much.
Natal : Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you.

[Box: How many cars were involved?]

A big lorry and a saloon car were involved in a serious accident yesterday morning at the stop in the Gamhuria street in Khartoum. The police confirmed that the lorry driver was wrong because he continued to drive while the traffic lights were on the red. A saloon car was coming at speed from the direction of the Blue Nile bridge. The driver saw the green lights and thought that the lorry was going to stop. But he saw the lorry before him when it was too late for him to brake. He hit his car against the lorry right in the middle. The lorry swerved and rolled from the round-about and overturned at the road side.

**Lesson 11**
**More about Animals.**

**A. Look at these pictures and read the three stories about them.**
[Image: A shark.] [Image: A Nile perch.]
[Box: What is the difference between a Shark and the Nile perch?]

The shark is a very big type of fish that lives in the sea. The Nile perch is also a big fish found in the River Nile, but it is smaller than the shark. The shark is a very dangerous fish because it can eat people. The Nile perch is less dangerous than the Shark for it can fight people but does not eat them. The Shark has very sharp teeth while the Nile perch doesn't have teeth. The Shark is therefore bigger and more dangerous than the Nile perch.

[Image: An ostrich.] [Image: A duck.]
[Box: Does an ostrich run faster than a duck?]

2. An Ostrich is a large bird which does not fly but it can run very fast. The Ostrich is wild and has a long neck. Its feathers are long and soft and can be used for cleaning tables, plumes and for decorations. The egg of an Ostrich is like a small ball.
The other bird is the duck. The duck lives in water and it can swim very well. It does not run very well and its eggs are like that of the hen. The duck has short but beautiful feathers which are not useful. Ducks are used as meat.

[Image: A baboon.] [Image: A gorilla.]
Look at the pictures of the two monkeys. The one on your left is a baboon and the one on the right is a gorilla. The baboon is a common monkey because it can be found very easily, whereas the gorilla is difficult to find. Gorillas live in equatorial forests and they feed mostly on fruits. The baboons also eat fruits but they destroy people's crops. Gorillas are cleverer and friendlier than the baboons.

3. If you were a bird, where would you fly to?
4. The Nile perch eats small fish, frogs and many types of insects; why do you think it does not eat fish with horns?
5. Compare the feathers of an ostrich and those of a duck.

**D. Read these lines and write similar lines about yourself.**
What I'd like to be.
If I were a bird,
I'd be a lovely dove.
I'd carry words of peace,
and fly all over for love.

I'd keep a look out,
To see if the burglars were out and about.

Maridi Intermediate School,
Western Equatoria State,
Maridi.
30 July, 1990.

Dear Ohaj,
I am glad to tell you that I arrived at Maridi two days ago after spending ten days on the way between Port Sudan and Maridi. I was very happy indeed to see my relatives again.
As I had promised you before I left, I am writing you this letter to thank you and all your relatives in Port Sudan for the splendid hospitality which was shown to me during the one month I spent with you. I enjoyed my stay very much and I must tell you that it was the happiest time of my life.
I told my friends here about all the wonderful things which I saw in Port Sudan. I talked to them about the site of the port, the time we spent swimming in the sea and the nice sea food which I ate most of the time I was there. Please tell your parents that I shall never forget all the wonderful things they did for me.
Our school has already opened and I am now in my new class. I shall write you a long letter soon to tell you more about Maridi. I am glad to tell you that my parents have asked me to invite you to our home in Maridi during your next long vocation.

Yours sincerely,
Erisa Samuel,

One week after Yousif got his driving licence, he wanted to drive alone for the first time. His friend Ahmed was helping him to remember some of the most important traffic rules by asking some questions.

Ahmed: Yousif, what will you do if you see a red traffic light in front of you?
Yousif: Of course I must apply the brakes and stop the car. I musn't go ahead even when the amber light is on. I must wait until the green light is on.
Ahmed: That's correct, and what do you do when you see a policeman?
Yousif: I'll watch him. If he holds his hand up, I must stop.
Ahmed: You are right. When you are driving, you must always watch the traffic lights and the traffic policeman. You mustn't look away. When you come to a round about you must allow the cars on your left to go first before turning. You must keep to your side of the road all the time.
Yousif: Thank you very much, Ahmed, for your good advice. I must go and try these things on the roads.

One day, the science teacher in Soba Primary School arranged a visit to the zoo for his pupils. The pupils wanted to see and to study how some of the animals behave. They bought their tickets and entered the zoo. They were met by Hassan Osman, one of the zoo keepers. He was ready to help them.

"My name is Hassan Osman. I am the keeper of this part of the zoo. I take care of the giraffes and the elephants. In the morning I clean their houses and give them water. I also look after the lion. i clean his cage and feed him".

Here is the lion's cage.
[Image: A lion in a cage.]
"How many times do you feed the lion?"
"Lions eat two or three times a week. They only eat meat. Please don't stand too close to the cage. Lions are the fiercest animals in this zoo and very dangerous. Let's now go to the giraffe's house".

"Why do you put their food and water on a platform?" asked one of the boys.
"You know that the giraffe is the tallest animal in the zoo. It is very difficult for it to eat and drink from the ground."

[Image: A giraffe eating from a high platform.]

"Where is the elephant house?"
[Image: An elephant.]
"Now you can come to see the biggest animal in the zoo. That elephant is the largest of them all." The boys were watching the elephant eating while using its trunks. One of the boys was giving some nuts to the smallest elephant.
"Don't feed the animal, please, it is not allowed," shouted the keeper. "Remember I told you from the beginning that some animals are dangerous."
"Oh! it's time to feed the lions. I must leave you now. You can go to see other parts of the zoo. Near here is the monkeys' house. The keeper will explain to you all about the monkeys. Have a nice day, but please remember that animals can be dangerous. Good-bye."

**Lesson 8**
**The Good Old Days.**

**A. Read this dialogue between Mahasin and her daughter Sawsan, and answer the questions:**
[Box: Why were things in the old days different from those of today?]

Mahasin was talking one evening with her daughter Sawsan about her old school days.
[Image: A mother and daughter talking.]

Mahasin: You don't know how lucky you are.
When I was a young primary school girl like you, things were different.
Sawsan: Tell me Mum, how were they different?.
Mahasin: I used to get up very early every morning to help my mother in making tea. I washed myself with cold water. That wasn't too bad in summer, but in winter it was very cold and I had no pullover. Nowadays we wash with warm water and we have warm clothes.
Sawsan: What time did you arrive at school?
Mahasin: We had to attend the morning assembly at seven o'clock although the school was three miles away from home, and we had to walk as there was no money for the bus.
Sawsan: Did you get much homework as we do now?
Mahasin: We get twice as much homework as you get these days. When I returned home I had lunch. I had to feed the chickens which we kept. After that I had a rest for one hour or played with my friends. Then I had to do my homework between six and eight o'clock in the evening. There was no electricity in our house, so I used a kerosine lamp for my studies.
Sawsan : What time did you go to bed?
Mahasin : We usually went to bed at eight o'clock. Of course there was no television to watch at those days.
Sawsan : What did you do on Fridays?
Mahasin : We used to wash our clothes and iron them on Fridays. After that we read the holy Quran and went to the mosque for prayers.
My parents were very strict about that.
Sawsan : What other things did you use to enjoy?
Mahasin : Our parents took us to visit relatives and friends. This was usually during the holidays. Sometimes we were allowed to go on visits by ourselves. Our parents didn't have to worry about us because there weren't as many cars on the roads and there weren't any problems of road accidents. We all worked very hard. And although we didn't have as much money as we do now, it was a simple life and we were very happy.

**B. Check your pronunciation by reading this poem.**
In English, sounds and letters don't agree. Why is break not rhymed with weak?
We say sew but also few
Cord is different from word
Cow is cow but low is low
Think of goose and choose
And think of comb and tomb
Doll and roll and home and some
And since pay is rhymed with say
Why not paid with said, I pray?
Think of blood and food and good
Why is it done, but gone and lone
Is there any reason known?
It's true that sounds and letters don't agree.

**Types of Birds.**

**A. Look at the picture and read the description about them.**
[Image: A collection of birds: vulture, crow, owl, hen, duck, swan.]

Can you name these birds and say which ones are wild?
In the picture in lesson 7 we saw some domestic animals: the camel, the donkey, the dog and the cow. We also saw the lion and the giraffe which are wild animals.
In this lesson we have some birds. Can you say which ones are domestic and which ones are wild?
Of course the hen, the pigeon and the duck are domestic birds. The owl, the vulture and the eagle are wild birds. Hens and ducks are kept for eggs they produce and for food.
In the past pigeons were used for sending messages. A pigeon could carry a letter from one town to another. Today this is no longer necessary because we have the telephones. Today pigeons are mainly kept for food.

[Box: Are other birds useful?]
The owl has big eyes and it flies by night to look for its food. It eats dangerous insects such as mosquitoes. Vultures eat the meat of dead animals. They help in cleaning our town and cities. The eagle is often called the king of birds. It feeds on small birds and snakes.

**Lesson 10**
**The Hen That Lay Golden Eggs.**

**A. Read this story carfully and answer the questions.**
[Box: Who gave Joanna the hen?]

Joanna was a very kind girl. She was very poor and sometimes she only had a crust of bread to eat. But she would give even this to anyone who asked for it. Because she was very kind, one day a magician gave her a beautiful white hen.
[Image: A girl receiving a hen from a man in a top hat.]

The next day Joanna went to the place where she had put the hen to see if it had laid an egg for her breakfast. What a surprise! The hen had laid an egg, but it was made of solid gold.
Joanna was very pleased and she took the egg to show her mother. Her mother sold the egg to a jeweller and used the money to buy food, clothes, shoes and many other things.
From that day on Joanna became rich but I am sad to say she also became unkind. On one occasion she shouted at a little boy who came to her house askingfor a crust of bread. The very next day when she went to the hen - what a disappointment! All she found were ordinary eggs.
"What's this! Where are the golden eggs?" shouted Joanna angrily.
"Cluck, cluck, cluck," said the hen. "I'll give you cluck, cluk, cluck you unkind girl!"
"Aren't you ashamed of laying such rubbish?" shouted Joanna.

[Box: Why did the hen lay ordinary eggs?]

Joanna began to beat the hen with her broom and the poor bird was very frightened. The next day the magician came back and said to Joanna, "The hen will not lay golden eggs while you're being unkind."
Joanna was immediately very ashmed and she understood that the punishment was well deserved. She ran out in search of the poor beggar she had shouted at and invited him to her house to eat. Joanna had learnt the lesson well and she was never unkind to anybody again. But made sure that all the poor children of the town had enough to eat.
