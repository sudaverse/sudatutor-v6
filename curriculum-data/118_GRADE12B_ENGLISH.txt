**CHAPTER ONE: TREES**

**SECTION 1: READING**

**① Trees for Life**

**A. Before you read, think about these questions.**
1. What areas of Sudan have forests?
2. What do we use trees for?

**B. Now read quickly to answer the questions.**

**Why do we need to take care of trees?**

The world faces two major problems today: how to meet the needs of an increasing population and how to improve the environment. Without a healthy, productive environment, we will not be able to feed the people of the world. Trees can help us to solve these problems.

Today great efforts are being made to raise people's awareness of the importance of trees and forests. All over the world millions of trees are being planted. In the Sudan also we need to make an effort to save trees and also make maximum use of them.

[Image of a palm tree and two other types of trees.]

--- Page 7 ---

**What do these figures tell us?**

The world population is now about 5,000 million. It is expected to rise to 8,500 million by the year 2025. Most of this increase in population will take place in developing countries. In these countries a 60% increase in agricultural production will be needed to make sure there is enough food for everyone. Already about 500 million people suffer from malnutrition and 15 million people die from it every year.

**What causes the loss of forests?**

If used properly, forest resources can lead to the development of the land and improvements in living standards for the people. Forests supply us with timber for building, firewood, fruit, nuts and gum Arabic. Trees are a source of fodder for cattle and a source of certain substances for medicine. The harvesting and processing of forest products creates employment, brings income and hard currency. This money can be spent to buy more and better food.

[Image of a tree, a hat, a book, a bowl, and a basket.]

--- Page 8 ---

Trees can protect the environment by reducing erosion and making the soil rich. The strong roots of the trees and the shelter of the leaves stop the soil from being blown away by the wind.

We must look after our forests and grow trees side by side other crops.

**C. Read the text again carefully and answer the questions.**
1. What is the expected rise in the world population?
2. Why is such a big population a problem?
3. Agricultural production should be increased by 500 million tonnes. Is this true or false?
4. Make a list of all the good things mentioned in the passage which we get from trees.
5. Try to find words in the passage which are similar in meaning to the following:
   a) very important
   b) lack of good food
   c) the gathering of crops
   d) food for animals
   e) dollars, sterling, etc.

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. Do you think the area where you live has a healthy or a poor environment? Why? Why not?
2. Do you have a forest near your town or village? If so, what is it used for?
3. How could you improve your local environment?
4. Where in your area do you think trees should be planted? Why?

**② The SPINE Gum Arabic Scheme**

**A. Read this advertisement quickly. What does it tell people to do?**

**ADVERTISEMENT**

**SPINE GUM ARABIC SCHEME**

Sudan supplies 80% of the world market for gum Arabic and our exports are worth millions of dollars.

**THE SPINE GUM ARABIC SCHEME....**

**...... STOP DESERTIFICATION ...... PRODUCE MORE FIRST CLASS GUM ARABIC........**

**TREES FOR LIFE......TREES FOR LIFE**
**....TREES FOR LIFE...TREES FOR LIFE....**

--- Page 10 ---

**B. Read the advertisement again carefully and answer these questions.**
1. Why is gum Arabic important to the Sudan?
2. What does SPINE advise people to do?
3. Who will help the pupils do this?

**C. Discuss these questions.**
1. Can millions of gum Arabic trees really be planted? Why? Why not?
2. Think of the ways you can help in planting gum Arabic trees in your area.
3. Make a map of where gum Arabic trees are grown in Sudan. Ask your geography teacher to help you.

**③ Trees for fuel**

**A. Read this conversation between Mr. Green and his son. What are they talking about?**

**Son:** Father, you keep saying, ‘Plant trees, make the Sudan green.’ But do people cut down many trees?
**Mr. Green:** You know, son, firewood is the main source of energy in developing countries. More than 2,000 million people are dependent on wood and charcoal for cooking and preserving their food. In developing countries, eight times more wood is used for fuel than is used for other purposes.

[Image of a woman cooking over an open fire. Image of a tree with stumps around it, indicating deforestation.]

--- Page 11 ---

**Son:** Mmm... Do we really need to cook food?
**Mr. Green:** Oh yes! Human health often depends on cooking food. Some food can be poisonous if not cooked because cooking can destroy germs. People also need firewood for boiling water which is important for the prevention of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera.
**Son:** But how can people get enough wood and keep trees at the same time?
**Mr. Green:** That's a very important question, son. There are many things which can be done. For example, we can use fuel-efficient stoves. These stoves are specially built to prevent the heat escaping and therefore less charcoal is used. Also, trees that are needed for fuel can be planted on unused land such as pathways.

**We must make sure we replace the trees we use.**

[Image of an axe next to a tree stump with a sad face.]

--- Page 12 ---

**B. Read the dialogue again and answer these questions.**
1. List all the advantages of trees Mr. Green mentions.
2. Which ways of saving trees are mentioned?

**C. In pairs act out the conversation.**

**SECTION 2: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with words**

**A. Copy the table below into your notebook, then go back to passage 1 about 'Trees'. Fill in the table with nouns which have similar endings. Add other words which you know to each column.**

| Nouns ending in ............ | | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **...tion** | **...ment** | **...ion** | **...ity** | **...th** |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

**B. Now do the same thing for adjectives.**

| Adjectives ending in ......... | | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **...y** | **...ive** | **...al** | **...d/ed** | **...uous** |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

--- Page 13 ---

**C. Use the words to make up questions to ask the rest of the class.**
Example 1: erosion Why is soil erosion not good?
Example 2: healthy How can people stay healthy?

**D. In the same reading passage we find the word 'firewood'. It is like other words such as 'policeman' and 'headache'. What do you notice about these words? We call them compound words. Can you complete the sentence? A compound word, then, is a word which ............**

**Complete the following to make compound words you have already learned then make a quiz which includes these words.**

black .... egg .... scare ....
arm .... rain .... bed .... cup ....
sky .... door .... break .... hand ....
screen post .... work .... room ....
house .. police .... fire .... head ....

Example: blackboard - What is a blackboard made of?

**E. We often use abbreviations to save time and space. The United Nations, for example, is often called the UN; 'please turn over' is often written PTO.**

**Work in groups and write out what each abbreviation stands for.**

UN WHO VIP ARABSAAT SUDATEL
a.m. p.m. m.p.h. UK USA

**Can you add some more? Use a dictionary to help you.**

--- Page 14 ---

**② Grammar Corner: The Passive**

**A. Look at these sentences from passage one, 'Trees'. How would you describe the form of the phrase underlined?**

'All over the world millions of trees **are being planted**.'
'... a 60% increase in agricultural production **will be needed**.'

**These sentences are in the passive. The writer could have said:**

'All over the world people are planting millions of trees.' and
'We will need a 60% increase in agricultural production.'

**What is the difference between these two sentences and the sentences of similar meaning used in the passage?**

**B. Now change these statements into the passive. Do you agree with the statements?**

Example: People cut down trees for fuel.
Trees are cut down for fuel.

1. People use charcoal for cooking.
2. We must look after our forests.
3. Trees grow beside other crops.
4. We can prevent diseases like cholera.
5. People buy gum Arabic.
6. We import oil.
7. We will soon export oil.

--- Page 15 ---

**③ Time for Tenses: Past, Present and Future!**

**A. Try this quiz on forming tenses.**
**Give the past, present and future of these verbs.**

Example: eat
**PAST:** ate, has eaten, was eating, has been eating, used to eat
**PRESENT:** eat/eats, is eating
**FUTURE:** will eat, is going to eat

arrive, buy, catch, earn, fly, give, help, jump, keep, live, make, need, offer, put, quarrel, run, swim, try, visit, win, drink

**B. Look at the pictures below and decide:**
what is happening now?
what has just happened?
what is going to happen?

1. [Image of people cheering at a sporting event or concert.]
2. [Image of people queuing at a check-in desk at an airport.]

**SECTION 3: WRITING: USING NOTES**

**① Read this!**

**A. Read these notes and try to think who wrote them and what they are about.**

1. my car - right side of road - other car - too fast - wrong side of road
2. 30 teachers - new buildings - good head teacher - clever students - needs money for new library.

**What has been missed out of the sentences to make notes?**

**② Step by step**

**A. Read the following notes then try to match them to the paragraphs below.**

Note 1: rural people - farmers - money for things
Note 2: conclusion - advantages, take care of trees
Note 3: introduction - importance of trees in world
Note 4: small industries - example

--- Page 18 ---

A. It is true to say that trees and forests have got many advantages. Therefore we should look after them and make sure forests are increased all over the world.

B. There are rural people with little or no land. Trees can bring cash which they can use to buy food, clothes and medicine. Local farmers can also buy the tools and chemicals they need to improve the land.

C. Trees support large and small industries around the world. They create jobs for millions of people. Money gained from trees and their products is very important for rural people and for the economy of each country.

D. In some countries there are small industries. These industries are organised by members of the local community. They collect the raw materials for producing certain products. In India, for example, such industries earn about 30 million pounds sterling.

--- Page 19 ---

**③ Over to You**

**A. Write notes only about these subjects. Use the notes to talk about them to the class.**
1. The advantages of trees in your area.
2. The things your school can do to persuade people to plant trees.
3. Advice to someone about how to improve their English/get good marks at school.
4. A visit to the zoo/your relatives' village/a big city.

Dear Aunt Layla,

We trees are very grateful to all the people who look after us and keep their animals (especially the goats!) away from us.

However, there are people who cut us down without thinking. Sometimes our young ones are destroyed as soon as they are planted. Please make life easy for us - we want to help you!

Yours sincerely,
Hopeless

Don't lose hope! You are still young, green and beautiful. Cheer up! There are thousands of people who love you and are ready to protect you. Be patient - our SPINE readers are doing their best to help you live longer and spread throughout Sudan.

Best wishes,
Aunt Layla

**CHAPTER TWO: YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY**

Young people like to dream about their future and also enjoy the present. But present joys and future dreams often involve problems as we shall see......

**SECTION 1: READING**

**① Job Hunting**

**A. What problems do you think you will find mentioned in the passage?**

**Now read the passage to answer the questions and also to see how many of your problems were mentioned.**

**Why was it difficult for Rachel to find a job?**

Rachel Peter spent six months looking for a job after she passed the Sudan School Certificate. Wherever she applied for work, she was told that unless she had skills in computing, it would be difficult to find a job. In spite of the difficulties, Rachel did not give up. She continued hunting for a job with other friends. Finally she decided to enrol in the SPINE Computer College in Khartoum. After one year there, she was awarded a diploma in computer management.

Immediately after that, Rachel applied for a job advertised in one of the local newspapers. This time Rachel attached her School Certificate, the computer diploma and two recommendations from people who knew her. A week later, she was invited to go for an interview.

[Image of Rachel Peter's face.]

--- Page 24 ---

**How many people were interviewed?**

Rachel was the third on the list of ten applicants who had come for the interview. She waited anxiously for her turn to come. The bell rang and the secretary told Rachel to go in. She was told to sit down at the end of a long table. On each side sat two members of the board and the chairperson sat the head of the table opposite her.

'Are you Rachel Peter?' the chairperson asked.

'Yes, sir, I am.'

'You told us you are interested in working in our computer section.'

'Yes, that's right,' said Rachel. 'I have just completed a one year course in computers and I am very interested in working with you.'

'Good.' said Mr. Alpayo, the chairperson, smiling. 'My colleagues here have some questions to ask you.'

'Thank you, Mr. Alpayo,' said Mr. John.

'Rachel, can you type?' asked Mr. John.

'Yes, sir, I can do fifty words per minute,' Rachel replied.

'I can see that your spoken English is very good. What about your written English?' asked Mr. Ibrahim.

'At school I always got A or B+ for my essays. I also teach English composition to some of my neighbours so I learn while correcting their mistakes,' Rachel replied.

--- Page 25 ---

[Image of an interview panel with four men and Rachel sitting at a table.]

'Can you tell us what you've learned in your computer studies? Mr. John continued.

Rachel took a deep breath and began to explain how long it had taken her and what she had learned. Rachel spoke politely and in a relaxed way. She looked around and saw that all of the members of the committee were listening carefully to what she was saying.

**How long had Rachel's interview lasted?**

At last Mr. Alpayo thanked Rachel.

'The interview is over. You'll be hearing from us soon.'

Rachel thanked him and left the room. When she looked at her watch, it was half past one - the interview had lasted about an hour!

Rachel hurried home. She found the family anxiously waiting for her. They asked her to tell them how the interview had gone. She told them over lunch the details about the office and the interview. When she had finished, her mother said, 'It sounds as though you did well. I hope you'll hear good news soon.'

--- Page 26 ---

**What was the result of the interview?**

Two weeks passed without any news about the result. Soon after that, her father brought her a letter. Rachel was so nervous that she could not open the letter. Her mother had to open it for her. She read it quickly and then she shouted, 'Rachel, they have offered you the job!'

Rachel grabbed the letter and read it herself.

'Oh, I'm so happy,' she said.

All the family and the neighbours came to congratulate Rachel. She found her new job very exciting, but she was sorry for many of her friends who were still unemployed. However, Rachel always advised those friends to do some training in computing and typing and to learn English and French.

**② 'Two wheels': are they worth the risk?**
A British teenager was riding his new bike and listening to his 'walkman' radio. He did not hear the bus overtaking him as he crossed to the middle of the road. He was killed instantly.
[Image of a bus overtaking a cyclist, with a car approaching.]

In this passage we will discuss the danger of 'two wheels' - scooters, bicycles and motorbikes - and think about the question: 'Are they worth the risk?'

**A. Think about these questions before you read.**
1. Which do Sudanese young people prefer - bicycles, scooters or motorbikes? Why?
2. Why do you think young people like 'their own two wheels'?

**B. Now read the passage and answer the questions.**

**What is this section about?**

During the last twenty years or so, most teenagers in British cities have had bicycles, but now there are less bicycles than before. Even those teenagers who have them do not use them as often.

Instead, scooters are more common. This change may seem a sign of progress to young people, but are

[Image of a modern scooter/motorbike.]

--- Page 29 ---

scooters and motorbikes really a change for the better? A traffic policeman was asked why young people prefer scooters to bicycles. He said that there are several reasons: firstly scooters are much faster and do not need much physical effort; secondly, the rider can take a passenger with him on the seat behind; above all, riding a scooter gives a young man a feeling of independence because he can travel farther and impress his friends.

On the other hand, the policeman talked about the disadvantages of scooters. Scooters are more expensive to buy and to repair than bicycles. Also, he said that scooters encourage young people to take risks by going too fast. As a result, scooters are involved in more serious accidents than bicycles.

**Are bicycles completely safe?**

The traffic policeman said that, in his opinion, bicycles are safer and easier to control than scooters. This is because the young people learned to ride them as young children. Nevertheless, bicycles, too, are not very safe in cities these days. This is because there are more cars, and drivers often do not pay attention to bikes. In addition, many cyclists do not know the rules of the road.
[Image of a traffic policeman directing traffic.]

**What is the solution?**

The traffic policeman said finally that young people should be made aware that scooters are the most dangerous form of transport on the roads and those who ride bicycles should learn the Highway Code. But the safest solution would be to make special lanes for cyclists to keep them apart from cars.

--- Page 30 ---

[Image of a cyclist on a tree-lined bicycle lane.]

Abdu was a lazy student. He always left today's work for 'tomorrow'. His English teacher had often advised him to change this bad habit.
One day Abdu took his homework to be corrected. He had written it in a hurry because he was pre-occupied with so much work. He did not have time to re-read it. Abdu had not foreseen how angry his teacher would feel about his careless work. If he had revised his work, he could have removed the mistakes which he had made. The composition was about the weather forecast.

[Image of a student looking sad at his desk.]

--- Page 32 ---

After he had read the composition, the teacher wrote in red, 're-write the whole composition'. Abdu read the comments and said, 'I have been repaid for my carelessness'. He later decided to review his work and also to reconsider how he spent his time.

**SECTION 3: WRITING: SUMMARY**

**① Read This**

When we read (or listen to something we are interested in or need to know about, we cannot remember every word. It is often useful, however, to be able to remember and write down the most important or main points. This is what we do when we write a summary. Look again at the passage in Reading 2 of this chapter which talks about bicycles and scooters and read the main points given below. Do you agree that these are the four most important points? If not, which one(s) would you remove and which one(s) would you add?

1. During the last 20 years, teenagers have decided to use scooters instead of bicycles.
2. Teenagers prefer scooters to bicycles because they are faster and have seats for carrying their friends.
3. Bicycles are cheaper and safer than scooters.
4. Special places on the road for bicycles might help to keep cyclists safe.

**② Step by step**

Look again at the passage about 'Trees for Life' in Chapter 1 and:
a. write down the main points (you can also use notes.)
b. put the main points in your own words.
c. put the main points/notes into connected sentences.

--- Page 40 ---

**③ Over to You**

**A.** Read again the dialogue about 'Trees for fuel'. Following the steps above, write a summary of it. Your summary should be about a third of the length of the original passage.

**B.** Find a story or article from a book, magazine, newspaper article which you can understand and are interested in. Summarise it for the class wall magazine. Add pictures if you can.

**CHAPTER THREE: DOING THE RIGHT THING**

Everyone wants to 'do the right thing' - to behave well and make good decisions. But what is 'right'? What does it mean to behave 'well'? What is a 'good' decision?

In this chapter we are going to read about different people and the choices that they made. We can then decide for ourselves if they 'did the right thing'.

**SECTION 1: READING**

**① Tito and Tana**

It is a tradition in some societies that if a man wants to get married, the girl's father can ask for a large dowry for her. We are going to read about Tito and Tana who lived in such a society and wanted to marry each other.

**A. Read the story below and answer the questions.**

**What happened to Tito's money?**

Tito was a farm worker who loved Tana very much and wanted to marry her. Tana's father asked Tito for two years' wages as a dowry. 'If you do not have the money after two years, I promise you that Tana will be married to someone else!' said Tana's father.

Tito worked hard every day and gave the money he saved to his brother Lendo to keep it safe for him. The years passed and Tito had almost enough money to marry Tana. One day, however, Lendo's child became very ill.

--- Page 43 ---

Lendo took the child to the doctor who asked for a large amount of money to make the child well. Lendo had very little money and he was worried about his child. Finally, he took the money that his brother Tito had given him and paid the doctor. Lendo's child became well.

**What do you think happened next? Read to see if you were right.**

When Tito found out that his money was gone, he was very sad. He went to Tana's father and said, 'Please give me one more year to pay the dowry. My brother has taken all of my money to save the life of his sick child.'

'What has that to do with me?' cried Tana's father. 'You have not kept your promise, but I will keep mine. Tana will be married to someone else.'

Tito ran to tell Tana about her father's decision. Tana decided to leave her father's house and stay secretly with Tito's relatives in a village far, far away. When Tito had saved enough money, he would join her and they would be married.

**How do you think the story will end? Read to find out if you were right.**

'My mother will be very sad,' said Tana. 'She loved me more than all of my sisters, but they will take care of her.' Tana left home quietly one night. The next morning, when her mother Zelga realised her daughter had gone, she wept bitterly. She was so sad that she became weak and sick. She died soon afterwards of a broken heart.

--- Page 44 ---

[Image of people in a traditional village setting; Image of a man standing over a woman in a sickbed.]

**B. Read the story again carefully and answer these questions.**

1. How much was the dowry for Tana?
2. What were the 'promises' mentioned by Tana's father?
3. Why did Tito give his money to his brother?
4. Why did Tana leave home?
5. What happened to Zelga at the end of the story? Why?
6. Say whether the following statements are true or false.
   a. Lendo was a doctor.
   b. Tito was employed by Tana's father.
   c. Tito was a lazy person.
   d. Tito asked his brother to give back the money.
   e. Tana went to live with Tito's relatives.
   f. Tana was Zelga's favourite daughter.
   g. Tana had only one sister.

**C. Discuss these questions.**
1. In the story, which people 'did the right thing'?
2. Now make a list of the people from the best to the worst. Explain why you listed them in this order. Do you think Tito and Tana will get married and live 'happily ever after'? Give a reason for your answer.

--- Page 45 ---

3. What would you have done if you had been:
   a) Tito b) Tana c) Lendo d) the doctor?

**② Closer to home**

The story about Tito and Tana took place in another country. Now we are going to look at two stories that could happen in our own situation and are therefore 'closer to home'. The situations are about two important values: honesty (telling the truth) and loyalty (being faithful to people).

**A.** Faisal and his cousin, Jamal, were asked by their family to go each Friday to help their grandfather so that he could rest. They went to tidy his garden, feed the animals and wash the car. Faisal worked very hard, but when no one was looking, Jamal took out his football magazine, read for a while, then fell asleep.

Usually Faisal was able to do all of the work, but one day he was not feeling well and when his grandfather woke up there was still a lot of work to be done. Grandfather was angry and said he would make sure that both boys were punished.

[Image of a boy sleeping. Image of a boy washing a car.]

--- Page 46 ---

**If you were Faisal, what would you do? If you were Jamal, what would you do?**

**B.** Nadia is sitting next to Selma in an examination. Selma writes a question on a piece of paper so that Nadia can give her the answer. A teacher who knows that Selma is a clever girl but has missed a lot of work because her mother was sick, sees Nadia take the paper.

**If you were Nadia, what would you do? If you were the teacher, what would you do?**

**③ Martin Luther King**

**A. Think about these questions before you read.**
1. Have you heard of Martin Luther King?
2. What do you know about him?

**B. Now read quickly to answer the questions.**

**What is this section about?**

[Image of Martin Luther King Jr.]

Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta, Georgia on 15 January 1929.

From an early age, he was aware that black people were not treated as equal citizens in America. Most blacks lived in poverty in the richest nation on earth. They earned only half of the white people's wages and many could not vote. In many places blacks were separated from whites; there were shops and restaurants that only white people could use. Even on the buses, black people had to stay in the back of the bus.

--- Page 47 ---

**How did Martin Luther King plan to change the situation?**

Martin Luther King believed that these things were not right. He believed that the only way to make society more equal was by peaceful protest. For example, he organised a 'bus boycott' which meant that black people refused to use the buses until they were allowed to sit in any part of the bus. Many similar protests were organised by Martin Luther King.

He never used violence but always looked for a peaceful way of protesting. However, some people who did not like what he was doing, used violence against him: his home was

**How and when was he killed?**

bombed, he was stabbed and his family was threatened. He still believed, though, that violence and hatred could only be overcome by love and forgiveness. In 1964 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and in 1965 all black people were allowed to vote.

In 1968 a white man called James Earl Ray shot Martin Luther King dead. Today Americans remember his peaceful fight for freedom and justice by having a public holiday every year called 'Martin Luther King Day.'

**C. Read the passage again and answer these questions.**
1. Why was life difficult for black people in America?
2. Why did Martin Luther choose boycotts as a way of protesting?
3. Was Martin Luther King popular with everyone? Give a reason for your answer.
4. Why do you think he was given the Nobel Peace Prize?

--- Page 48 ---

5. Find words/phrases from the passage which are similar in meaning to the words/phrases below.
   a. the same b. thought c. non-violent d. given

6. Below are some notes summarising the events of Martin Luther King's life. The notes are in the wrong order. Read them carefully and rearrange them correctly.
   a. Awarded Nobel Peace Prize
   b. Organised 'bus boycott'
   c. Born in Atlanta
   d. Shot by James Earl Ray
   e. Black people given vote.

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. If you were asked to give a Peace Prize to someone famous or someone in your area, who would you give it to? Why?
2. Why do you think Americans still want to remember Martin Luther King?

Example: My father caught a fish that was as big as an elephant.

--- Page 53 ---

[Image of a giant fish next to an elephant.]

**SECTION 3: WRITING: COMPARING**

**① Read this!**

A student at Khartoum University who lives in Atbara compares travelling by bus to travelling by train. Read then note down the expressions he uses to make the comparisons.

Personally, I prefer travelling by bus. It is faster and does not make as many stops as the train does. I suppose the train is safer and in some ways more friendly and you have more time to talk to people. For me, the greatest advantage of the bus is that it leaves very early in the morning when it is cool. It is easier to sleep on the train and sometimes even read a book!

Certainly the bus is more expensive than the train and also, I find, more reliable. My brother doesn't think so. He always takes the train because he says it is the safest, cheapest, most comfortable, most convenient, most sociable means of transport. I have to say that my brother also works for Sudan Railways!

--- Page 54 ---

**② Step by step**

When you compare things or situations, you can start by thinking of the **adjectives** or **adverbs** you want to use.

Look again at the passage above about trains and buses and make a list of all of the adjectives and adverbs.

Once you have decided what your adjectives/adverbs are, you can think of other points which are different e.g. advantages and disadvantages.

From the passage, note down the advantages and disadvantages of a) trains and b) buses.

**③ Over to you**

1. Now compare one of the following pairs. Remember to put points which are about the same topic in the same paragraph.
   a. the way your mother and your father treat the children.
   b. sick people and healthy people.
   c. old people and young people.
   d. Fridays and other days.

2. Now write your topic as homework then read it to the class to see if they agree with your opinions.

**CHAPTER 4: EDUCATION**

**Section 1: Reading**

**① Education: Why bother?**

**A. Think about these questions.**
1. Make a list of the different places in which you have been educated so far? How many are there? How long did you spend in each one?
3. Can you be educated without going to university?
4. Can you be educated without going to school?

**B. Read the passage quickly to answer the questions.**

**Which people does education help?**

Education, more than ever before, is an important issue all over the world. If a country wants to develop, it must take education seriously. But what do we mean by education? Here is a general definition which tells us what education is and what it is for:

'Education means acquiring the knowledge and skills that will help a person to: develop himself, earn his living and contribute to the development and prosperity of society.'

According to the definition, education helps us to know things (knowledge) and to be able to do things (skills). The reason for education is to help us develop as people, to earn money for ourselves and our families and also to help the people around us.

--- Page 58 ---

**What is this section about?**

The important question is, of course: How do we do this? Many people think of education as **formal education** - going to school, university, educational institutions. Formal education is very important because in our modern society we need people with specialist skills such as engineers, scientists and technicians. The fastest and simplest way for these people to get their knowledge is through formal education.

[Image of a large, classical-style university building.]

Yet even today, many people, both young and old do not go to school or university. We have to remember that a lot of knowledge and many skills are passed on from one person to another **informally**. The person who made the clothes you are wearing or the chair you are sitting on, or who repaired the bus you came to school in - all of them have acquired knowledge and skills. They use what they have learned to earn their living and also to help you! Yet many of them may not have gone to school.

--- Page 59 ---

There are also many examples of people who have become writers, scientists, engineers even leaders of their country without ever going to school! These people are **self-taught** and have made the effort to find the books and other materials they need and learn by themselves. This takes a lot of time and patience and determination. For most of us - it is easier to go to school!

**C. Now read the passage again carefully to answer these questions.**
1. Make a list of all the advantages of education mentioned in the passage.
2. Formal education is one type of education mentioned in the passage. What are the other two types of education?
3. What are the differences between these three types of education?

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. Is it necessary to have formal education in order to be useful in society? Give reasons for your answer.
2. Why do some people choose not to go to school?
3. The passage says that being self-taught ... 'takes a lot of time and patience and determination. For most of us - it is easier to go to school!' Do you agree with this statement?

**② Success Story: Abdalla Ragab**

**A. Before you read tell the class what you already know about Abdalla Ragab.**

**B. Read the passage then answer the questions below.**

[Image of Abdalla Ragab.]

Abdalla Ragab was one of the most famous popular Sudanese journalists. He was fluent in

--- Page 60 ---

Arabic and English and his ability in these languages was so good that he could translate from one to the other very quickly. In 1976 he became a translator for the Organisation of African Unity (O.A.U.).

Soon he became famous not only as a translator, but also as a journalist. His work was so good that many foreign newspapers and magazines recognised him as a well-informed and talented correspondent. He published his own newspaper 'Al Saraha' which was sold all over the country. His articles were not only informative, but also entertaining.

Abdalla Ragab, then was a very famous and successful man. It may surprise you to know, therefore, that he never had any formal education. He was self-taught! He succeeded because he had a strong will and desire to gain by himself the knowledge and skills he needed.

Before he died he wrote down all his experiences in a book which is called 'The Diary of an Ordinary Man' ('Muthakirat Aghbash').

**Questions**
1. In what two ways did Abdalla Ragab use his skill in language?
2. What important jobs did he have?
3. What is 'The Diary of an Ordinary Man' about?

**C. Discuss these questions.**
1. What do you admire most about Abdalla Ragab?
2. Here is a list of famous people who did not have formal education. What are they famous for? Do you know of any others?
   a. Mohammed Ahmed Al Salamabi.
   b. Al Sheikh Mustafa Al Amin.

--- Page 61 ---

**③ Girls' education: A luxury or a right?**

**A. Before you read, answer these questions.**
1. Do you think both boys and girls should be educated? Why? Why not?
2. Should they have different kinds of education or study the same subjects? Give reasons for your answer.

**B. Read the passage quickly and answer the questions.**

[Image of a young girl's face, partially covered.]

**Find two advantages of sending girls to school.**

Twice as many girls do not go to school as boys. Yet giving girls a basic education is one sure way of giving them the ability to choose the kinds of lives they wish to lead. This is not a luxury, but a basic human right.

Education for girls, therefore, is important in giving them the chance of a healthier and happier life. It is also important for society as a whole. An educated woman has the skills, information and self-confidence she needs to be a better parent, worker and citizen. The children of an educated mother are more likely to survive.

An educated woman will also be more productive at work - and better paid. Studies say that an extra year at school will increase a woman's earnings by 15 per cent, compared with 11 per cent for a man.

--- Page 62 ---

**What is this section about?**

In the past 20 years much progress has been made in girls' education. Between 1970 and 1992, school enrolment for girls in developing countries rose from 38 per cent to 68 per cent. But there is still some way to go. In the least developed countries, only 47% of girls go to primary school and 12% to secondary school.

What would help more girls to be able to go to school? Below are some successful ideas from many different countries.

1. Families and communities must work with schools in choosing subjects and managing the school.
2. Basic education should be free or cost very little.
3. Schools should be built close to where people live and have women teachers. Many parents worry about girls travelling long distances on their own. Many parents also prefer their daughters to be taught by women.
4. Learning materials should be relevant to the girls' life and experience. It should also be in the local language.

(From: 'The State of the World's Children 1996 UNICEF)

**D. Read the passage again carefully to answer these questions.**
1. Make a list of all of the advantages of education for girls.
2. Say whether these statements are true or false:
   a. More girls go to school in developed countries than in developing countries.
   b. More girls in developing countries go to secondary school than primary school.

--- Page 63 ---

c. Over half of the girls in developing countries do not go to primary school.

3. The report makes four suggestions for making it easier for girls to go to school. Which of the suggestions (numbers 1,2,3,4 or a combination of these):
   a. involves money?
   b. talks about where the school should be?
   c. talks about what pupils study?
   d. talks about who should help organise the school?

4. Find words/phrases from the passage which are similar in meaning to these words/phrases.
   a. courage b. stay alive c. wages d. improvement
   e. near f. related to g. native

**E. Discuss these questions.**
1. 'Twice as many girls do not go to school as boys.' Do you think this it true for the area where you live?
2. The passage states that education for girls is 'not a luxury but a basic human right.' Do you agree? Give reasons for your answer.
3. Look again at the suggestions at the end of the passage. Put the list in order with the most useful suggestion at the top.
4. Look again at the suggestion which you put at the top of the list. What could be done in your area to put it into practice?

**SECTION 2: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**Stories**
We all like listening to stories or reading them. Some of the most interesting stories are very old. Like many old songs, dances and proverbs, such stories are part of the national culture. They are not only pleasant and amusing stories, but a source of wisdom and good advice as well. Some stories are based on fact. Some are called legends: they are about imaginary heroes and gods. But the most popular stories are about ordinary people, like the short stories about Joha.

Dear David,
How are you? I haven't heard from you for ages. We're fine. I'm sitting here by the fire, writing to you. Jim is here, too. He's ironing some shirts. My two sons are sleeping. Grandfather is staying with us these days. At the moment he's fast asleep and snoring loudly.

Anyway I have to go now. I want to see the 'World of Sports' programme at 10 p.m. It is going to start in ten minutes. Write and tell us what you are doing.

**SECTION 4: WRITING: Description using notes**

**① Read this!**
Ahmed wants to describe his favourite hobby to his penfriend. Read the notes he made, then the part of the letter that he wrote.

**Playing the guitar**
- classical music
- started when I was 18
- used to practise in the afternoon
- don't play very much now
- a new guitar

My main hobby is playing the guitar. I usually play classical music but I can also play some folk songs. I started to play about fifteen years ago when I was eighteen years old and I am still learning. I used to practise for 2 hours everyday. I don't play as much now because I don't have a lot of spare time. I would like to buy a new guitar soon but a good guitar can cost a lot of money.

**② Step by step**
The table below shows some important language we can use when describing things. Try to find examples of each one in what Ahmed wrote.

**CHAPTER 5: WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION: LIFE-LINE FOR DEVELOPMENT**

**SECTION 1: READING**

In 1995 a Women's Conference was held in Beijing, China for women all over the world to come and discuss their problem and the solutions they had found. It was a great opportunity for all people - women and men - to think carefully about the role of women in society. It is a good opportunity for us to do some thinking too!

**① Women in Development**

[Image of silhouettes of people, mostly women, working in a factory or workshop setting.]

**A. Look at the pictures above.**
1. Is the person in each picture a man or a woman? Why do you think so?
2. Is the person doing something which will help develop their country or not? Why? Why not?

--- Page 72 ---

**B. Ms. Suzi Kwong, a delegate from Hong Kong at the 1996 Women's Conference in Beijing, China, gave this speech. Read it quickly to answer the questions.**

**What two world problems are mentioned?**

[Image of Ms. Suzi Kwong.]

We are here because we want change - change for women, change for our communities, change for the better. We want to move forward into the future and not live in the past. The past has much that is good and much to teach us. But as we go forward we need to leave behind ideas and actions and attitudes which are no longer helpful.

**What is this paragraph about?**

Let us begin with the past. The traditional image of women is of women being dependent on men, staying at home all the time waiting for help and support. This idea that women are dependent and unproductive is not really true. Such an idea will delay any serious efforts to end hunger and reduce poverty. Years of experience have shown that poverty does not disappear through welfare and charity but through economic activities carried out by both men and women in all situations. We need to see women as they are: active, effective participants in development.

**What is Ms. Kwong unhappy about?**

Some people think that women's contribution to the economy is not very great as most of them stay at home and don't go out to work. However, recent studies have shown that women in all situations work towards improving the living conditions of their

--- Page 73 ---

families and developing their country as a whole.

Women work in the fields to grow crops to feed their families and to sell in the market for others to buy. They work in the home to cook meals, clean the home, wash the clothes in order to make life comfortable for the other people in the family so that they can do their own jobs better. Women also bear children and bring them up. These children are the future developers of our country. Women also work in the markets, in offices and in small businesses to increase the family income. However, it is sad that all these activities are not seen as economic activities. In order to show that women do contribute to the economy, something needs to be done.

But what can be done? Women should be given practical help and encouragement to participate in both economic and social development. For example in many countries in the world women farmers have been allowed to get bigger areas of land, bank loans and technical help in order to produce more and better crops. This has resulted in both good income for the family and a good supply of food for the area. As well as practical help, women need to be included in making decisions about what happens in their country. In the Sudan, for example, we hear that women's issues are part of the 10 Year Strategic Plan.

Some progress is being made, but there are still many problems to be solved: legal, financial, social and above all educational. We need to realise the importance of good education for women.

Yes, we need practical help. Yes, we need education. But we are not simply asking for society to make a contribution to women. We are asking the society to recognise the contribution that women already make to it.

--- Page 74 ---

[Image showing four different portraits of women's faces.]

**② Views from around the world**

After Ms. Kwong's speech other delegates were given the chance to comment. Below are some of the points they made.

**A. Read each one and say what main point the speaker is making.**

**Ms. Susham Patel (India):**
Ms. Kong has raised a very important point about the image of women. Yes, we are mothers, cooks, housewives and we are clearly seen as those things. But that is only part of the picture: we have other skills as well - we are workers, professionals, writers, scientists. Why is it that many people choose to see women as housewives but not head teachers, as cooks but not clerks, as mothers but not managers? People have been blind for too long. We need to open their eyes so that they can see the full contribution women make to society.

**Ms. Zeinab Ahmed (Chad):**
I agree with Ms. Kwong's point about women's role in ending hunger. The situation is urgent and the war against hunger needs to be fought by all people. It is dangerous not to involve women in this fight. If women are not involved the fight will be lost. But if women are to fight hunger, they need weapons such as education, training and financial support. Above all, our efforts need to be

--- Page 76 ---

recognised and encouraged.

**B. Read the speakers' comments again and answer the following questions.**
1. 'People are blind...' says Ms. Patel. What does she mean by this?
2. According to Ms. Ahmed, why is it 'dangerous' not to allow women to take part in development?
**C. Write a short speech like the two above to answer one of the points made by Ms. Kwong.**

**SECTION 2: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with words**
**A. Masculine and feminine gender words**
1. Look at the following lists of words :-
   a. student, teacher, doctor, farmer, nurse
   b. father, mother, son, daughter, uncle, aunt, waiter, waitress, actor, actress, policeman, policewoman

What do you notice about the words?
List a - contains words which refer to both males and females.
List b - contains words which refer very definitely to males or females.

2. We need to remember that nowadays, the English language is changing: The nouns 'man' and 'men' and words ending in

--- Page 77 ---

-man (e.g. 'spokesman') were once used to refer to male or female. The pronouns 'he' and 'him' were used in the same way.

**For example:**
1. Whoever loses his passport will be fined.
2. Man can do many things which animals cannot do. His interests are not only life, food etc. but also beliefs and values.
3. There is a policeman's post advertised today.
4. They chose a spokesman for their committee.

**But**, now English speaking people use **neutral words** to replace the masculine words.

**For example:**
1. Whoever loses a passport will be fined.
2. Human beings can do ......................... Their interests are not only .........................
3. They chose a spokesperson for their committee.
4. There is a police officer's post ...................

[Image of a man and a woman both pointing at a board.]

3. Put the following words into the columns under the headings **male: female: both**.

landlord/ actor/ bull/ teenager/ musician/ king/ scientist/ aunt/ landlady/ teacher/ hairdresser/ nurse/ cousin/ queen/ person/ doctor/manager/ headmaster/ head teacher/ chairperson/ waiter

| male | female | both |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| actor | aunt | musician |
| | | |

4. Here are some sentences in which the masculine or feminine gender words are underlined. Which of these refer only to men or women and which refer to people in general? Change the general ones into gender neutral words. (Choose from the list of words given below and add others if you need them).

1. **Man** must fight malaria.
2. The average working **man** earns more than **he** did three years ago.
3. English **men** prefer tea to coffee.
4. Give a **man** a fish and **he** will eat for a day. Teach **him** how to fish and you'll feed **him** for a lifetime.
5. The rich cannot possibly understand the effect of inflation on the average working **man**.
6. **Men** have always hoped to conquer disease.
7. We wrote a letter to the **chairman** of the board.
8. They employed a new **foreman**.
9. The shop needs more **salesmen**.

**③ Time for Tenses: The Past Perfect**

1. Read this passage to find out why Amir went to hospital.

Amir is a little boy from rural Darfur. He came to Khartoum to live with his aunt in order to go to school. Last month he felt sick for three days. He had caught a cold. Although his aunt had kept him in bed and had given him medicine for three days, he still did not feel well. On the third day he developed a fever. At that time his aunt took him to hospital to see the doctor. He had always been afraid of doctors and hospitals. In Darfur he had been very healthy and so he had not seen many doctors.

The doctor did a blood test for Amir and found the problem. Amir had also developed malaria and it had caused the pain and fever.

The doctor gave him medicine and Amir felt better.

2. Look at these verbs from the passage.
   **He came to Khartoum.**
   **He had caught a cold.**
   Which is in the past simple and which is in the past perfect?

3. Now list the verbs in the past simple and those in the past perfect.

4. Remember the past perfect is used to describe an action that happens before another action in the past.

Look again at each verb in the past perfect and decide what happened before it.

--- Page 80 ---

5. Below is a list of events when Ahmed had a car accident. The list is not in order.

**Retell the story by putting the sentences in the right order. You will need to change some of the verbs into the past perfect tenses to make it clear when the events took place.**

a. Ahmed came to Khartoum to visit his aunt.
b. He lives in Wad Medani.
c. He broke his leg.
d. He had a car accident.
e. His car crashed into a lorry parked in the middle of the road.
f. The doctor kept him in hospital for three weeks.
g. The police came to his rescue and took him to hospital.
h. Ahmed did not want to stay in hospital.
i. He hated hospitals.
j. Ahmed was not well.
k. The doctor re-examined him.
l. Ahmed developed an infection in addition to the injury.

**SECTION THREE: WRITING: ARGUMENTATIVE**

**① Read this!**
Reread the speech by Ms. Kwong at the Beijing conference. How did she **support her argument?** Read the comments of the other two speakers. What kind of language did they use to **persuade their listeners?**

--- Page 81 ---

**② Step by step**
1. **REMEMBER:**
   a. A good argumentative essay discusses the arguments for the topic and attacks the arguments against the topic.
   b. You should state the **main point** of the argument and then give reasons to support it. It is not enough in argumentative writing to say, for example "Women will not make good ministers" unless you give reasons.
   c. In argumentative writing your aim is to change the way your readers think about a subject or to get them to take action.

**OPINIONS + REASONS = A GOOD ARGUMENT**

2. Here are some arguments listed for you with reasons. For each argument decide which reasons are for or against.

The topic is:
**'WOMEN SHOULD NOT BECOME MINISTERS.'**
a. Women would make good ministers.
   - They already make decisions as MPs and judges etc.
   - Men would not accept decisions made by women.
   - They are emotional and hesitant.
   - Women make decisions every day about practical things.

b. Women cannot give all their time to professional work.
   - Women have to take care of their children when they are sick.
   - Women are less strong physically than men.
   - There are kindergartens for children.
   - In Sudan there are plenty of relatives to look after the children.
   - Women spend a lot of time visiting neighbours and looking after guests.

--- Page 82 ---

c. Men would not listen to a woman minister.
   - There are many women in Sudanese society who are respected by men.
   - At home men do not take orders from women.
   - Men believe women are not serious and responsible.
   - A minister has power and people would listen to a man or a woman because of that.

**③ Over to you**
1. Write an essay of three paragraphs or more (300-400 words) using the arguments for and against given above. Remember to use linking words/phrases e.g. because, as we can see, however, therefore, on the other hand etc.
2. Choose a topic of your own and write an argumentative essay.

A thief was in court, and the judge asked him "You admit having broken into a dress shop four times?"
"Yes," answered the suspect.
"And what did you steal?" asked the judge.
"A dress, your honour," replied the suspect.
"One dress?!! But you admit to breaking in four times, "said the judge
"Yes, your honour, "replied the suspect. "But three times my wife didn't like the colour."

A woman visited her friend to congratulate her on the marriage of both her son and daughter. She asked:
"What kind of a man did your daughter marry?"
"Oh, he's wonderful," replied the mother. "He lets her sleep late, wants her to go to the hairdresser's regularly and takes her out to dinner every night."
"That's nice," said the visitor. "What about your son?"
"I'm not so happy about that", the mother said. "His wife sleeps a lot of the time, spends a lot of time at the hairdresser's and makes him take her out to dinner every night!"

Dear Aunt Layla,
I am eighteen and I live with my parents and my seventeen and sixteen year old sisters.

--- Page 84 ---

They are both in the secondary school. My problem is that my sisters refuse to do things for me. They do not want to serve me with food and wash my clothes. They always tell me that they are also busy studying like me and I should wash my own clothes and prepare my own food. This makes me very angry and I feel it is not fair. I am the future breadwinner and supporter of the family. I should be served and made comfortable to be prepared for my future role. My parents agree with me but my sisters never listen to that. Can you please advise them?

Yours sincerely,
Ali

Dear Ali,
I am afraid it is you who needs to be advised. Your sisters are right in telling you to do things for yourself. They are also right in wanting to spend their time studying like you. It is high time you realised that women are not there simply to serve men. Your sisters have the same rights to education and comfort as you do. They could equally be the future breadwinners of the family. Stop complaining and look around to see how the world has changed!

Yours sincerely,
Aunt Layla

**CHAPTER SIX: FOOD AND NUTRITION**

**SECTION 1: READING**

**① Food for life**

**A. Let's begin thinking about food by looking at this big Sudanese food tray. Can you divide the foods into groups?**

[Image of a large circular tray filled with various food items: bread, chicken, fish, vegetables, fruits, milk, salt, etc.]

**How did you decide which foods were in which groups?**

--- Page 86 ---

**B.** We all know that we need food for life. All living things need food and water in order to survive. You can live without food for three or four weeks, and without water for two or three days, but the hunger and thirst you feel make you try as hard as possible to find food. When your stomach is empty, it sends messages to you to eat!

Your body needs the substances in food for energy, for growth, for repairing your body and keeping it healthy. When the supplies of these substances decrease, you begin to feel tired and you get sick more easily.

These substances are called **nutrients**. Nutrition is the study of how the body takes the nutrients from food and uses them. There are six types of nutrient: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and water.

**Now each nutrient will introduce itself!**

We're the **PROTEINS** - the tissue builders. We play an important role in forming the body's cells. We help to build hair, nails and skin. We are needed to repair the body's cells. We are found mainly in meat, fish, eggs, milk and chicken and also partly in vegetables and cereals.

[Image of two muscular men posing.]

--- Page 87 ---

We're the **CARBOHYDRATES** - we're energy! Listen! If you don't have enough of us, your body will begin to use stored fat and protein for energy. Our best sources are cereals, vegetables and fruit. These foods are broken down by the body to form a simple sugar called glucose. Be careful! Too much of us can lead to overweight and tooth decay.
[Image of two people running.]

We're the **FATS** - the great stores of energy. We store energy and control body temperature. Without us skin and hair problems may develop. You find us in meat, butter, milk, cheese etc. You do not find us in fruit and vegetables. Again, be careful! Too much of us can cause serious health problems such as being overweight, having heart problems and high blood pressure. Use oil which is made from vegetables like sunflower oil.
[Image of an overweight man.]
[Image of a sunflower.]

--- Page 88 ---

We're the **VITAMINS** - the miracle workers! We help the body to stay healthy and to work properly. We work together to help the body make use of other nutrients. We are present in the body in very small quantities, but you cannot live without us. If some of us are not present, you will develop serious illnesses. See how useful we are..........
**A** is good for healthy teeth, strong bones and good eyesight.
**B** helps brain tissue to develop and also helps digestion.
**C** helps the body build cells used in healing cuts and bruises. It also makes strong teeth and bones.
**D** again helps teeth and bones.
**E** keeps the red blood cells healthy.
[Image of a doctor.]

We're the **MINERALS** - the body protectors. We work in different ways to keep the body working well and protect it from disease. There are quite a few of us, including calcium, iron and sodium.
[Image of a person with a sword and shield.]

Hey! I'm **WATER**! I form 66-75% of the human body. I am the basic material in blood and cells. I help transport nutrients all over the body and I carry waste products away. I help move food round the digestive system
[Image of a person drinking from a clay pot.]

--- Page 89 ---

and keep your body at the right temperature. In Sudan, because of the hot weather, your body is always losing me! So make sure you get enough of me! I don't cost very much, but please make sure I'm kept safe and clean.
[Image of a traditional water cooler (zeer).]

**B. Copy the table below into your notebook. Now go back to the nutrients and read about them carefully to fill in the table.**

| NUTRIENTS | USES |
| :--- | :--- |
| Proteins | |
| Carbohydrates | |
| Fats | |
| Vitamins | |
| Minerals | |
| Water | |

**C. Discuss these questions.**
1. What types of food available in your area at different times of year?
2. What are your favourite foods? Why do you like them?
3. Are you going to change your mind about what you eat? Explain your answer.

**② Living to eat..... or eating to live?!**
**A. Read the passage and find out how many different reasons for eating are mentioned.**

--- Page 90 ---

Why do we eat? That may sound like a silly question, but there are in fact many different answers.

The main reason for eating is hunger, the physical desire for food. But people also eat when their stomach is not completely empty. They are not really hungry, but still have an appetite for food. The smell of fried fish, the sight of porridge, meat or kisra make you want to eat.

Food also helps you to meet social and emotional needs. People enjoy having meals together. Special occasions such as Ramadan or Christmas are often celebrated by special meals. In the Sudan and in other countries, choosing and preparing delicious food is a way of showing love and hospitality.

Your emotions can influence your eating, too. When you are worried or upset or disappointed, you may lose your appetite. You may also eat quickly and get indigestion. Some people eat very little when they are very excited or very depressed.

Of course, we do 'eat to live', but there are times when we simply enjoy eating. At those times we can also say that we live to eat!

**B. Read the text again and answer these questions.**
1. Say whether these statements are true or false.
   a. There is only one reason for eating.
   b. We only eat when we are hungry.
   c. People use food to make others feel welcome.
   d. Our feelings do not change the way we eat.

--- Page 91 ---

2. Look at the diagram below and describe the relationships between food and the other things in the diagram.
[Diagram showing FOOD in the center with arrows pointing to: weddings, Christmas, Ramadan, happiness, worry, sadness, family, eye, taste, stomach.]

3. Find words in the passage to match the meaning of these words/phrases.
   a. mend
   b. a taste for food
   c. looking after guests well
   d. an upset stomach
   e. feelings
   f. affect

**C. Discuss these questions.**
1. When do you eat special meals?
2. What gives you an appetite?
3. When do you not have an appetite?

**③ Sudanese eating habits: an expert speaks**

**A. Read the following interview on Radio SPINE and find one good Sudanese eating habit and one bad Sudanese eating habit.**

**Interviewer:** This is Radio SPINE. Welcome to the Family Programme. Our guest today is Professor Faiza Yousif Zumrawi.
**Interviewer:** Welcome to Radio SPINE and to the Family Programme.
**Professor:** Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.
**Interviewer:** Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your work?

--- Page 92 ---

**Professor:** Yes, of course. I'm professor of Human Nutrition and head of the Nutrition and Dietetics Unit in the Home Economics Department at the Faculty of Education, University of Khartoum. The Department focuses on two main areas: Nutrition and Dietetics and Pre-school Education.
**Interviewer:** What do you think about Sudanese food and nutrition in general?
**Professor:** All of the nutrients we need for health and fitness are available in Sudanese food. The food we actually eat, however, is affected by habits, customs, traditions, beliefs, religions etc.
For example, the meals which are prepared are often unfairly distributed among the members of the family. The best food is given to the men and guests; what is left is then given to the women and young children.
**Interviewer:** If we divide the Sudan into four big areas - North, South, East and West, do you think the people in these areas eat balanced diets?
**Professor:** I don't think so ........ I mean, food for a balanced diet may be available within an area, but those people may not actually choose to eat the right foods.
People in rural areas where there is plenty of eggs, milk, meat, green vegetables and fruit often don't eat them. They sell them to get a radio, furniture, gold bracelets etc. Unfortunately you may even see a child suffering from malnutrition because of this.
**Interviewer:** There are some good eating habits in Sudan, though, aren't there?
**Professor:** Oh, yes, there are. For example, young mothers who have just delivered a child are given milk mixed with 'helba' or wheat flour and sugar in the form of a thick drink or porridge. Mothers also have a very rich diet

--- Page 93 ---

during the first six weeks after delivery. These things help the mothers to stay healthy and also increase the production of breast milk for the babies. These habits should be encouraged.
**Interviewer:** And what about bad eating habits?
**Professor:** Well, some people in eastern and northern Sudan believe that eating fish and drinking milk will result in skin diseases such as vitiligo (baras). Also some think that if pregnant women drink goats' milk their baby will look like a goat! In some parts of Sudan some mothers do not give their children eggs thinking it will delay speech and others do not give babies meat for fear of worms which make children sick.
**Interviewer:** Well, you've certainly given us plenty of food for thought! Thank you very much for talking to us.
**Professor:** You're welcome.

**B. Read the dialogue again carefully and answer the questions.**
1. What is professor Faiza's job?
2. Make a list of the things which affect people's choice of food.
3. List the good and bad Sudanese eating habits mentioned.

**C. Discuss these questions.**
1. Which points do you agree with and which do you disagree with? Give reasons for your answer.
2. Can you add to the list of good and bad Sudanese eating habits?

**SECTION THREE: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with words**
**A. Word families.**
As you know, people live in families. Words also enjoy being in families! They can be grouped together because they belong to each other in some way. Look at the following families and add to them.

--- Page 94 ---

**VEGETABLES**
peas, aubergines, potatoes, okra .................

**FRUITS**
bananas, dates, grapefruits, oranges ..................

**INDUSTRY**
factory, electricity, machines, manufacturing ..................

**HEALTH**
doctors, medicine, cure, treatment ..................

--- Page 95 ---

**② Grammar Corner: Relative Pronouns**

**A. who, whose and which**
1. Amami and Sarah have been reading the 'Guinness Book of Records' which is full of interesting facts. Read what they found out about. Try to work out why the words underlined are used. (All of the facts are true!!)

1a. Amani read about a teacher. The teacher had been teaching for 81 years.
1b. She read about a teacher **who** had been teaching for 81 years.

2a. Sarah read about a couple. Their engagement lasted 67 years.
2b. She read about a couple **whose** engagement lasted 67 years.

3a. Amani read about a cigarette. The cigarette was eleven inches long.
3b. She read about a cigarette **which** was eleven inches long.

**NOTES:**
1. 'who' and 'which' can be replaced by 'that'.
Examples:
She read about a teacher **that** had been teaching for 81 years.
She read about a cigarette **that** was eleven inches long.

[Image of an artist painting a bridge.]

--- Page 96 ---

2. Now join these sentences in a similar way. Some of them are true, some of them are not. Which ones do you think are true?
   a. Sarah read about a boy. The boy had gone to university when he was 8 years old.
   b. Amani read about a wall. The wall was 3,460 km long.
   c. Sarah read about a lady. The lady's neck was 40 centimetres long.
   d. Amani read about a cat. The cat had five tails.
   e. Sarah read about an Indian man. His moustache was 337 centimetres long.
   f. Amani read about a teacher. The teacher had been teaching for 100 years.
   g. Sarah read about a Chinese man. His house cost thirty million dollars.
   h. Amani read about a woman. She weighed the same as an elephant.

**B. whom**
1. In spoken English nowadays, 'who' or 'that' is used at all times for people. In written English you will sometimes see the word 'whom'.

Read the following sentences and try to work out when 'whom' is used.
(Sarah is talking to Amani about people she met at a wedding.)

a. I met a friend. I had known her from primary school.
b. I met a friend **whom** I had known from primary school.

a. I met a neighbour. I had borrowed a dress from her.
b. I met a neighbour from **whom** I had borrowed a dress.

a. I met a teacher. I had studied with her at university.
b. I met a teacher with **whom** I had studied at university.

   b. I met a colleague. I used to play tennis with her.
   c. I met a friend. I had helped her to pass her exams.
   d. I met a relative. I had given some shoes to her.
   e. I talked to a friend. I had borrowed a tape from him.

**SECTION 4: SPINE CHALLENGE**

Dear Aunt Layla,
Does Home Economics really mean preparing expensive food using complicated tools in a modern kitchen? I ask this question because when you watch TV programmes, both local and foreign, they give you this impression. This makes people like you and me who come from a developing country depressed because we cannot afford to have such things. What shall I do? I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Undernourished

Dear undernourished,
The food and the cooking are more important than the pots and pans! We can make delicious and nutritious food using local cooking utensils. One of the most delicious meals I ever had was cooked by an Indian lady who sat on the ground and cooked bread over hot coals - without a pot or a frying pan! Many people with the most up-to-date equipment simply cannot cook good food because they do not use the right ingredients or take time to cook well. So don't worry! Simply enjoy your food and cook it in the way that produces the best results for you.

Best wishes, Aunt Layla

**CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPMENT**

**SECTION 1: READING**

**① Economic Development:**
An interview with Mr. Abdel Wahab Ahmed Hamza, former Sudan State Minister for Finance ('Newsweek' - July 8, 1996)

**A. You are going to read about different aspects of development, but before that, make a list of:**
1. three development problems and development successes in your state.
2. all of the development organisations you know about and what they do.
3. local development projects and their work.

**B. Read this interview on economic development in Sudan and note down the main development areas mentioned by the Minister in the interview.**

**What are the overall economic conditions in Sudan?**
The economy is now growing by six to eight per cent a year. We have become self-sufficient in agriculture, so that we are now exporting cereals as well as sorghum, oil seeds and sugar. A major road building programme is in progress and rail freight has increased ten times and is now up to two million tons a year. All this has come entirely from Sudanese resources.

[Image of Mr. Abdel Wahab Ahmed Hamza.]

--- Page 107 ---

**Sudan is a vast country. What natural resources do you have?**
Sudan is indeed large, the biggest country in Africa. A recent report by the Arab Organisation for Development stresses our agricultural potential. Our livestock resources are great with possibilities for expansion and with strong Middle East markets for our cattle and sheep. We already have the largest livestock population in Africa. Our fruit and vegetables also have a large export potential. We have plenty of water, and the cost of irrigation is quite low. The 'underground' Nile, the big basin which the river feeds, is as large as the surface Nile.
Most of our exports were of live animals. We now have modern slaughterhouses, with efficient and privatised tanneries. Our Red Sea coastal waters are rich in fish. We also have gold, chrome, marble, granite, oil and natural gas. Transport improvements are making it easier to exploit our natural wealth.

[Image of a combine harvester in a field.]

**What about human resources?**
We have invested heavily in higher education. We now have 25 universities and institutes of higher education, where originally there were only four. The university intake was 555 in 1962. It reached 38,600 in 1995, so you can see the effort that is being

--- Page 108 ---

made. The literacy rate is over 80 per cent and increasing. We do not suffer from over-population pressures. We have 25 million people in an area of almost a million square miles. So the human picture is bright.

**Are there specific areas where you wish to see foreign participation?**
We are interested in export industries to help our economy. For example, we would like to see leather goods manufacture and meat canning develop alongside the new slaughterhouses. Food processing and animal feed are suitable for investment. Textile manufacture is growing alongside cotton production. Several agro-industry projects are ready and are now looking for finance. Land is available, some of which has not been used since Adam and Eve. Petroleum and natural gas exploration is important. We have large energy reserves which need investment and expertise. We have major road and airport building programmes to open more of the country for development, and to link the far South, West and North. The Western Salvation Road is a 1,200 kilometre project. We also are others from Khartoum to Port Sudan and to Kassala. We also wish to continue to modernise the rail system and the shipping fleet.

**In which sectors are foreign companies already active?**
The Kenana Sugar Company is an example of a Sudanese company that has become a world-sized sugar grower and manufacturer with foreign participation. Canadians are participating in oil exploration and exploitation. The banking sector also has several joint projects with foreign companies and banks.

**Do you see a potential in tourism?**
Yes. We have an enormous variety of peoples, with different customs, costumes and foods from Turkish and Bedouin to

[Image of a traditional character, possibly a storyteller or jester.]

--- Page 109 ---

African. History, too, for the Roman Nubia is part of Sudan. Our landscape is varied: pasture land, desert, hill country, the Red Sea coast. There is a large quantity of wildlife so the Sudan is ideal for safaris. We are improving tourism in the East, Central and Northern regions.

**Read the passage again and decide whether these statements are true (T) or false (F).**
1. Air freight is mentioned by the minister.
2. Sudan has enough agricultural produce for the country.
3. Rail freight has stopped altogether.
4. Sudan sells a lot of sheep to Middle-Eastern countries.
5. Water and land are 2 of Sudan's greatest resources.
6. There is no oil in Sudan.
7. The number of universities in Sudan has doubled.
8. The population of Sudan is 22 million.
9. The minister thinks exports are not important.
10. The minister does not want foreign companies in Sudan.
11. Complete these statements with a word or phrase from the text you have just read. Decide if the statements are true (T) or false (F).
   1. Saudi Arabia .......... oil.
   2. The Nile is the .......... source of water in Sudan.
   3. People earn more money in industry than in ..........
   4. Companies should .......... some of their money in community service.
   5. .......... buildings are not very attractive.
   6. .......... for all people is more important than higher education for a few.
   7. Good education develops a person's ..........

**D. Discuss this question.**
1. What aspects of industry, agriculture, tourism etc.

--- Page 110 ---

a. are being developed and
b. could be developed in your area?

**② The Sweet Smell of Success**
**A. Read this report on the Kenana Sugar Plantation Scheme and write down two interesting facts you did not know before.**

The Kenana Sugar plantation is located near Rabak on the east bank of the White Nile. It was founded in 1975 as a joint project between some multi-national corporations, some neighbouring Arab countries and the Sudanese government. The Sudanese government is, of course, the major share-holder. The scheme is now managed by the Kenana Sugar Company (KSC).

[Image of workers at the sugar plantation.]

The scheme has changed Kenana from an area of scrub-land into one of the world's largest sugar plantations. It provides employment and stable living conditions for the nomads living in the area and for a large Sudanese workforce drawn from many different parts of the country. The Kenana plantation contains a main town area with a mosque, primary and secondary schools and a modern 70-bed hospital. There are also a number of small villages with primary health care facilities and vocational training centres. Most of the workers live in these villages.

The scheme also provides business opportunities for various service industries, for example shops, restaurants, banks, etc. in the Kosti/ Rabak area and elsewhere. Kenana and other factories should bring to the Sudan self-sufficiency in the production of sugar and also produce enough sugar for export.

Moreover, the Kenana project has produced benefits for the Sudan,

--- Page 111 ---

both in terms of new products and valuable skills and experience. In addition to white sugar, Kenana is now manufacturing sugar cubes and sugar syrups.

There are a number of projects planned for the future including the production of charcoal from sugar by-products. This charcoal will help Sudan and its neighbours to cut down fewer trees and so help the fight against desertification in the region. It is also possible that animal feed and vitamins can be made from the by-products of sugar.

As Sudan continues to develop, the Kenana Sugar Company will provide a model of success from which many can learn.

**B. Read the report again carefully and answer these questions.**
1. Complete this information sheet about the Kenana project.

**FACT SHEET: KENANA SUGAR PROJECT**
1 LOCATION
2 STARTING DATE
3 MAIN PRODUCTS
4 MAIN BY-PRODUCTS
5 PROFIT IN DOLLARS FROM PRODUCTS
6 SHAREHOLDERS

2. What changes has the Kenana project caused in the area?
3. List all the advantages of the project.
4. Make a list of things which you think are 'environmentally friendly' and those which are not.
5. Complete these questions with words or phrases from the passage, then answer the questions.

--- Page 112 ---

a. Is Sudanair a national or an .............. company?
b. Which countries have mainly coffee ..............?
c. Which companies provide most .............. for people in your area?
d. In which areas of Sudan is .............. a problem because trees and plants do not grow?

**C. Discuss this question.**
1. Make a list of the 'success stories' in development in your area, and discuss one.

**③ Is the 'Developed' World Really Developed?**
**A. Think about these questions.**
1. Name some countries in the 'developed world'.
2. Why did you choose these countries?
3. Look at the advertisement on page 109. How would you describe the men? How do you think they feel? Are there any differences between the man in the middle and the other two? If so, what are they?

**B. Read the advertisement quickly. What is it about?**

**C. Read the advertisement again and answer these questions.**
1. Is the literacy rate in the USA getting better or worse? Give reasons for your answer.
2. Who can help and how?
3. How does the advert encourage people to take part?
4. Will these 'teachers' be paid? How do you know?
5. Make up opinion questions using the following words and ask your friends what they think.
   Example: standard: Do you think the standard of English in your school is good?
   a. skills b. decade c. volunteer d. adult e. average

--- Page 113 ---

[Image of three men; the two on the outside are looking angry or frustrated, while the man in the middle is calmly reading a newspaper.]

Read that again, just to be sure you read it correctly.
Because, believe it or not, it's true. Even today, about one American adult in three can't read adequately. And each year reading skills continue to decline while the standards for literacy keep rising. By the year 2000, Americans will need greater reading skills than ever before, but fewer Americans will have them. If this continues for two decades, US World Report foresees an America with a literacy rate of only 30%. Which means that the average person with three grandchildren could find that two of them are considered illiterate. Before that America comes to be, you can stop it by joining the fight against illiteracy today. You need no special qualifications. If you can read, you can teach or help us in many other ways. You'll be trained to work in courses in your own community, sharing the satisfaction of seeing people learning and growing. And you'll know that you're not just helping them but their children and grandchildren, too. Because you're stopping illiteracy before it reaches them. So join the fight against illiteracy. Call us free on 800-228-8813.

**Volunteer Against Illiteracy. The only degree you need is a degree of caring.**
(Source: Coalition for Literacy)

--- Page 114 ---

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. Were you surprised by the advert? Why? Why not?
2. Why do you think there is such a problem?
3. Are there other ways in which the 'developed' world is not really 'developed'?
4. Which country in the developed world would you like to visit? Why?

**SECTION 2: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with words**
**A. Phrasal Verbs**
There is a special group of verbs with two or three words in each verb. These are called **phrasal verbs**.

1. Look at the underlined phrasal verb in the following sets of sentences. What do you notice about them?
   1a. He **sat down**. b. He **fell over**.
   2a. She **looked after** her sick mother. b. The other day I **came across** an old friend. c. The thief **broke into** the house.
   3a. You may **come up against** unexpected difficulties. b. I **look forward to** reading your book.

2. Complete the following:
   In set (1), a verb is followed by ............
   In set (2), a verb is followed by ............
   In set (3), a verb is followed by ............

Be careful! In a phrasal verb, the meaning is different from the meaning of the verb on its own. You cannot therefore guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the usual meaning of the verbs and the adverbs etc. Notice, for example, the difference in meaning between these sentences.

--- Page 115 ---

1a. Please **carry** my bag.
1b. Please **carry on** working.
2a. The plane **took off**.
2b. She **took off** her coat.

3. In pairs try to work out the meanings of the underlined phrasal verbs in the following sentences.
   a. She is **looking after** her sick mother.
   b. She is **looking for** a job.
   c. The dentist **pulled out** my tooth.
   d. The Americans eventually **pulled out** of Vietnam.
   e. I thought you **brought up** a very interesting point at the end of the lecture.
   f. Her mother died in childbirth and she was **brought up** by her father.
   g. I **looked over** my shoulder.
   h. I **looked over** the lecture notes you gave me.

[Image of a person tied to a chair: "I'm a bit tied up at the moment."]
[Image of people parachuting: "Thanks for dropping in."]

--- Page 116 ---

4. Study the list of phrasal verbs in this box, then choose the right ones to fill in the blank spaces in the sentences below.
(Remember also to choose the right tense of the verb.)

| hand over | put up with | wake up |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| fill in | turn down | hold up |
| catch on | hand in | consist of |
| deal with | take on | go over |

a. The local council .......... his request to open a shop.
b. Social workers help people to .......... their problems.
c. We must stop sleeping and .......... to the problem of poverty.
d. The rain will .......... the work on the new road.
e. The Development Bank must .......... the money now.
f. Many people .......... the job as project manager.

**Who might say these things? Where? Why? To whom?**

**② Grammar Corner: Order of Adjectives**
**A.**
1. When several adjectives come before a noun they usually go in a certain order.

Look at the following sentences and notice the type and order of the underlined adjectives. Can you work out some rules for putting them in order?

--- Page 117 ---

a. He married a **beautiful tall** lady.
b. She is wearing a **long black silk** dress.
c. He bought a **blue Japanese** car.
d. We met a **thin old** man.

Generally speaking, adjectives expressing personal opinion come first followed by size, age, shape, colour, nationality and material.

2. Put the adjectives between brackets into the right order to make sentences.
   a. Your teacher's daughter. (10 year old/pretty)
   b. A lady. (little/funny)
   c. A British woman in a dress. (plain/cotton)
   d. A student. (very bright/medical)
   e. A boy in a shirt. (woollen, striped, blue and white)
   f. A professor. (American/new/history)

**③ Time for Tenses: The Present Simple and the Present Perfect**

1. Read this passage and notice the use of the two tenses, then write the present simple in one column and the present perfect in another.

Jane is a teacher. She teaches at the secondary level. She works very hard. She often teaches 8 hours a day and never complains because she enjoys her work very much.

Since 1970 she has been teaching in Al Nahda Secondary school for girls. She has taught English, maths and physics and has helped many students to solve their learning problems. She is always very kind to her students who think she is the best teacher in the school.

--- Page 118 ---

Jane has also helped with school administration for a number of years. She has collected books for the library and has raised money to build a stage for the school plays. She has also done many good things for the school. Jane is indeed a very popular teacher and everyone admires her.

2. Look again at the verbs. What is the present simple used to describe? What is the present perfect used for?

3. Change the verb in brackets into the present simple or the present perfect to find out what Ahmed is and what he has done since 1980.

Ahmed (be) a scientist. He (work) for the MEGA Chemicals Company since 1980. He often (do) experiments on animals to test new medicines. Since he joined the company he (carry out) 200 experiments and all of them (be) successful. He also (test) many samples of meats, sweets, etc., and (found) that some of them (be) not suitable for humans to eat. Many people (think) that Ahmed (be) not kind to animals. They (criticize) him for that.

4. Now write a similar passage telling us what someone in your family has done since 1990.

**SECTION THREE: WRITING: DESCRIBING A PERSON**

**① Read this!**
Read this description of Afaf's sister Amna. What does Afaf describe in the first paragraph? What does she describe in the second paragraph?

--- Page 119 ---

Of all my brothers and sisters I like my sister Amna the best. She's also my mother's favourite. She's the eldest of the family. She's in her late forties, but quite young in spirit. She's married and lives with her husband and three children on a farm in a village near Kosti. She has a dark complexion, long black hair and big black eyes. She has a kind face and always meets people with a smile. Her face is a little wrinkled now round her eyes and mouth, but I think she's still quite attractive. She's the sort of person you feel comfortable with and can always go to if you have a problem.

She likes reading and working on the farm. She still tries to find time to go round shopping for books and magazines. She's extremely generous, but not very tolerant with people who don't agree with her. Generally she's a happy person, and I hope I'll be like her when I am her age.

**② Step by step**
1. The description includes factual description and personal opinion.
   Go through the description and in your exercise book write down all the examples of the two types of description. Make two columns as shown below: one for factual description and one for personal opinion.

   **FACTUAL DESCRIPTION**
   She's the eldest of the family.
   She's married with three children.

   **PERSONAL OPINION**
   I think she's quite attractive.
   She has a kind face

2. Look at the lists again. What kind of things does the writer describe? What kind of things does she give her opinion about?

--- Page 120 ---

**③ Over to you**
1. Now write a similar description of a person you have known for more than 2 years.
2. For homework write a description of the person you would like to be like when you are older.

**SECTION 4: SPINE CHALLENGE**

Dear Aunt Layla,
For some time I have wanted to write to you about something which takes up a lot of my thinking. I originally come from a village, but I've lived in the city with my aunt for a long time. I've really become a city person and can no longer fit into village society. When I go there to visit my parents during the school holidays I feel unhappy and bored and no longer enjoy the things they do. I do not want to talk to anybody. I lock myself in my room all day to keep away from them all. My father gets upset about my attitude, because he wants me to marry my cousin and come and live in the village with my uncle's family. He thinks that my aunt is pushing me to behave like that because she wants me to marry her son and stay with her in the city. My father always argues with my mother about this and threatens to keep me in the village and stop me going to school. I am afraid he might.

I don't want to live in the village, I don't want to leave school and I don't want my father to blame my aunt and my mother because of me. Please tell me what to do. I'm in a real mess.

Yours sincerely,
Nadia

--- Page 121 ---

Dear Nadia,
I am not surprised that you prefer living in the city. Most young people of your age get taken in at first by the variety of life in the city and think that village life is limited and boring. As you grow older, I am sure you'll change your mind and look at village life differently.

Your father is probably worried about you now and does not mean what he says. I am sure he realizes that you'll change in time. However, why don't you try to talk to him, and tell him what you hope to do with your life? You should also try hard to mix with people in the village and understand them. This will make them change their mind about you and treat you differently. It will also make your parents relax and stop arguing about you. If you try hard I'm sure you'll find a lot of support from everyone.

Best wishes, Aunt Layla

**CHAPTER EIGHT: A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE**

**SECTION 1: READING**
In this chapter we are going to learn about some of the differences in cultures, customs, habits and traditions that there are in the world. Are all people really the same? Are these differences unimportant or do they make 'a world of difference'? Read and make up your mind!

[Image of a globe.]

**① A World of Difference**

**A.**
1. Your teacher will give you TWO MINUTES to think of as many countries in the world that you know, and then he/she will write them on the blackboard.
2. Now tell the class what you know about the people of those countries - their habits, customs, traditions and so on.

**B. Read the passage below and make a list of the facts you already knew and those which are new. Which customs etc. seemed strange to you?**

--- Page 124 ---

In **SUDAN** the most common way of greeting is shaking hands or hugging (embracing) each other. People also tap or pat each other on the shoulder when they greet. This kind of greeting happens every time people meet. In **BRITAIN**, people shake hands, too, but only when they meet someone for the first time or when they meet after a long absence. They also shake hands when leaving, but only if they are not going to see each other for a long time. They don't shake hands every time they meet.

[Images showing different forms of greeting.]

In **CHINA, JAPAN** and many other countries in the **FAR EAST**, the usual way of greeting is bowing. Eskimos in **ICELAND** rub noses when they say goodbye!

**Punctuality** means arriving on time, but in some countries it means arriving late!

In **SUDAN** there is no hard and fast rule about punctuality. In **BRITAIN**, however, you should not come earlier than the agreed time and you should not arrive more than about fifteen minutes late.

[Image of people from different cultures waiting.]

--- Page 125 ---

In **BRAZIL**, your hosts will expect you about half an hour after the appointed time. If you go earlier than that, they will still be making the last minute preparations!

Some people believe that when they see or do certain things, something good or bad will happen to them. This is called **superstition**. Among the **AZANDE**, people do not eat the meat of brown pigs because they believe that anyone who eats the meat of a brown pig will get leprosy. Also among the tribes of **SOUTHERN SUDAN**, if a person who wants to travel stumbles with the left foot or sees a black animal or bird in the road, he will not go on his journey because these things are signs of bad luck. If, however, it is a light brown animal, like a gazelle or a white bird which they see, these are signs of good luck.

[Images of an owl, a dove, a fox, and a person stumbling.]

In **BRITAIN**, touching wood is thought to bring good luck. In the **USA**, they knock on wood and the **ITALIANS** touch iron!

If you visit a **TEMEIN** friend in the **NUBA MOUNTAINS** whose wife has just had a baby, do not make the mistake of asking whether it is a girl or a boy. You must say, 'Is it like your brother or your sister?'

--- Page 126 ---

In **THAILAND**, a visitor should not pat a child's head as we do in Sudan. They believe that spirits enter and leave a person's body through the head. Patting a child's head, therefore, seems rude and a sign of evil in Thailand.

People's **habits** vary from country to country. In **SUDAN**, people eat from one plate using their right hand. **EUROPEANS** eat from separate plates and use knives and forks; the **CHINESE** use chopsticks.

In some countries bad habits include talking with your mouth full, chewing chewing-gum and smoking or taking snuff in public.

When we meet people from different countries they may seem the same, but as we get to know them, we discover and learn to enjoy their different **worlds**.

**C. Read the text again carefully and answer these questions.**
1. What is the difference between the Sudanese way of greeting and that of the Thai?
2. When should a guest arrive at a party in Brazil?
3. Why do the Azande people not eat the meat of the brown pig?

--- Page 127 ---

4. Which of the following are considered signs of good luck?
   a. stumbling with the left foot
   b. stumbling with the right foot
   c. seeing a black animal or bird on a journey
   d. patting a child's head in Thailand

5. Find the words or phrases in column A which have the same meaning as those in column B.

| A | B |
| :--- | :--- |
| punctual | bad-mannered |
| rude | sign |
| symbol | way |
| hard and fast | on time |
| style | strict |

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. Do you agree or disagree with those who say too much greeting is a waste of time? Give reasons for your answer.
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of a) being punctual and b) arriving late for appointments?
3. What do superstitious people you know do when they want to: a. win a football match? b. find a good price for their goods in the market? c. be lucky in hunting, on a journey or in a lottery?
4. Name some good and bad habits in your society.
5. 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'. What do you think this saying means? Do you agree with it? Why? Why not?
6. Do you think there are sometimes good reasons for superstitions? Explain your answer.

--- Page 128 ---

**② Fashion**
We have just read about the different cultures, habits and traditions there are in the world. Now we are going to read about some fashions inside and outside the Sudan, to see whether what we wear makes 'a world of difference'.

**A. Before you read, think about these questions.**
1. Look at the pictures in this lesson. How are these people dressed? Do you dress like any of them?
2. Think about the different countries you know. What kind of dress do the people there wear?

**B. Now read the passage and note the facts you already knew and those which are new.**

[Image of a man in a Scottish kilt.]

The **kilt** is the traditional dress of Scotsmen. Nowadays, the kilt is worn only for weddings and other special occasions. In the past, however, the kilt was very practical and was worn every day. The colours came from dyes made from flowers and plants grown locally. Because of this, a man wearing a kilt could not be seen from a distance, so the kilt was a kind of camouflage. Also, each large family group or clan had a different colour so you knew who each person was by their dress!

You will also notice the small bag (**sporran**) around the man's waist. In the past, men kept dry porridge in it, then mixed the porridge with water from the river when they were hungry. Inside the top of the man's sock is a small knife (**dirk**). The man only needed to reach down for it if someone attacked him. Nowadays,

--- Page 129 ---

of course, the sporran and the dirk are simply part of the traditional dress.

The commonest traditional dress in **Southern Sudan** is the 'laawo'. As you can see from the picture, it is fashionable for both men and women. The main difference is that men usually wear a plain or white laawo, while women wear decorated laawo. Another difference is that men tie the knots over their left shoulders so that the right hand can move freely if they are attacked by an enemy. Women tie the knots over their right shoulder.
[Image of a man wearing a laawo.]

The normal size of a laawo is two square metres, although the length can vary from one person to another. What is important is that the lower end of the cloth should touch the ankles.

In the very old days, the laawo was made from tanned animal skins. Later, people made them from local cotton spun by hand. Women then dyed their laawos using the roots of special trees boiled in water.

From Southern Sudan, let's move to Eastern Sudan to see the popular fashions among the Beja, the Beni Aamir and the Reshaida. These tribes perform war dance. They all wear traditional dress short jalabias with very wide

--- Page 130 ---

and "sideri". The sideri is a fashionable waistcoat worn by men in that area. They also carry shields and swords. These were once used for self-defence. Now, they are used for cultural events. Long hair for men used to be popular, but now they have short hair.
[Image of a person wearing a 'sideri'.]

Women in Eastern Sudan generally wear 'tobes', but they tie them round the waist like the Indian 'Sari'. They cover their heads and faces. The Reshaida women wear long dresses and cover their faces completely except for the eyes.
[Image of a woman in traditional Eastern Sudanese dress.]

**C. Read the passage again carefully and answer these questions.**
1. Explain the ways in which the Scotsman's traditional dress helped him in his every day life.
2. How is a man's laawo different from a woman's? Why?
3. How has the purpose of the Beja man's sword and shield changed?
4. Match the following words/phrases with words found in the passage:
   a. disguise
   b. change colour
   c. jacket

--- Page 131 ---

**D. Discussion Questions**
1. Why do you think people like to wear fashionable clothes?
2. Do you think it is cheaper to buy ready-made clothes or those made by a tailor?
4. Are there any fashions which you think should not be allowed? Which ones? Give reasons for your choice.
5. What do you think the following are made from:
   a. a sporran b. a shield c. a sword d. a dirk.
6. What do you like wearing:
   a. everyday?
   b. for parties and special occasions?

**SECTION 2: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with Words**
**A. Expressions of Quantity**
1. Read the dialogue between a customs officer and a passenger. Write down all of the words/phrases which tell us the quantity of things which he has or does not have e.g. 'much', 'any'. Can you work out when each expression of quantity is used?

[Image of a customs officer inspecting a passenger's suitcase.]

--- Page 132 ---

**Officer:** What have you got in your suitcase?
**Passenger:** I have got my personal belongings and some gifts.
**Officer:** How much foreign currency have you got with you?
**Passenger:** Not much. I only have some American dollars with me.
**Officer:** There are a lot of bottles of perfume and a lot of watches in your suitcase. What are they for?
**Passenger:** Some of them are gifts and others are for my own use.

2. Complete these sentences with 'much', 'many', and 'a lot of'. Sometimes there are two possibilities.

Example: There weren't **many** videos in the box.
She paid **a lot of** money as a fine.

1. We'll have to hurry. We haven't got .......... time.
2. The Customs Officer found .......... gold in his suitcase.
3. The merchant sells .......... kilos of sugar everyday.
4. My doctor advised me not to eat .......... salt.
5. .......... people want the war to stop.
6. The injured soldier lost .......... blood.
7. We ate so .......... mangoes when we arrived in Nyala.
8. Don't disturb me. I've got .......... work to do.

**② Grammar Corner: 'to' + the infinitive/-ing**
1. Remember, we can use 'to' + the infinitive as we did previously.
   Let's practise this conversation in pairs between Rachel and her sister Mary.

--- Page 133 ---

**Rachel:** What has mother asked you to do, Mary?
**Mary:** She's given me some clothes to mend.
**Rachel:** Why are you not doing what you have been told to do?
**Mary:** I'm waiting for a pair of scissors to cut the cloth with.
**Rachel:** Why has mother not given you the scissors?
**Mary:** She's still looking for the key to open the box where she keeps the scissors.
**Rachel:** What will she do if she doesn't find the key?
**Mary:** She'll ask father to break the lock.

2. We can also use the verb + ing form as in the following examples:
   I enjoy going on picnics.
   She likes walking to school.

**Now make questions by putting the verbs into the correct form (sometimes both forms are possible)**

1. Do you like cooking/to cook? (cook)
2. Do you enjoy (listen) to the radio?
3. Have you ever tried (ride) a camel?
4. When did you start (learn) English?
5. Do you think it's easy (learn) a foreign language?
6. Are you interested in (garden)?
7. Do you like (get) up early?
8. Who taught you (swim)?
9. Are you good at (draw)?
10. Do you think it's important (have) a lot of money?

--- Page 134 ---

3. Now ask your neighbour these questions. Add some questions of your own - then ask your teacher!

4. Mona is visiting her friend Mariam. Complete the conversation. Use the correct form of the verbs in brackets.

**Mona:** I'm going into town this afternoon. Would you like (come) to come?
**Mariam:** I can't. I haven't finished (clean) my room and I promised (do) it this afternoon.
**Mona:** I don't mind (help) you (clean) the room.
**Mariam:** No, it's all right, really. Thanks for (offer), but I'd prefer (do) it myself. I'd like (go) out somewhere this evening, though.
**Mona:** OK. Where do you want (go)?
**Mariam:** How about (go) to the cinema?
**Mona:** I've no money (spend) on (go) to the cinema at the moment.
**Mariam:** Alright, then. How about (go) to the zoo for a picnic?
**Mariam:** That's a good idea. Let's plan (do) that, shall we?
**Mariam:** Yes. Let's go!

**③ Time for Tenses: The Present Perfect Continuous**
1. Read this conversation and read out to your teacher examples of the present perfect continuous tense. Explain why that tense was used.

**Abakar:** What are you doing here, Adam?
**Adam:** I'm waiting for Musa. We're going for a picnic.
**Abakar:** Oh! Musa has just arrived.

--- Page 135 ---

**Adam:** Good morning, Musa. You're very late. I've been waiting for you here for a long time.
**Musa:** Good morning Adam. I'm sorry for coming late. How long have you been waiting?
**Adam:** I've been waiting since eight o'clock. But why are you breathing so fast?
**Abakar:** I think he has been running.
**Musa:** Yes, I've been running for 15 minutes!

2. Complete these sentences:
   We form the past perfect continuous using ............
   We use the past perfect continuous ............

3. Fill in the blank spaces using the words given. Number one is an example. Remember also to use the correct preposition - 'for' or 'since'.

1. You/work here? How long have you been working here? (two months) I've been working here for 2 months.
2. Nawal/learn English? ................. (three years)................
3. Peter and John/live in Kosti? ................. (1989)................
4. Ohaj/wait in the restaurant? ................. (half an hour)................
5. Baby/sleep? ................. (2 o'clock)................
6. We/swim in the Nile? ................. (over an hour)................

--- Page 136 ---

**SECTION 3: WRITING: NARRATIVE**

**① Read this!**
1. Read the story and decide what the writer is talking about in each paragraph.
   A visitor to America writes about a frightening but funny event.

Last summer I visited my friends John and Kate Harris in the USA. One day John took us in his car to see the beautiful countryside around their home. We drove through a flat valley with high hills on either side. I was enjoying sitting in the back of the car looking at the hills.

After a while a strong wind blew up. The trees were moving backwards and forwards and there was dust everywhere. The road was now right next to the side of the mountains. Suddenly I noticed a large grey rock tumbling down the side of the mountain. It was heading straight for our car. John was talking a lot as he was driving, telling us about the history of the area. I thought he had not noticed the rock, so I hit him on the shoulder and screamed 'Stop the car! That rock's going to hit us!'

John and Kate looked at me in amazement, then laughed. They explained that the 'rock' was in fact a large soft plant in the shape of a ball. John and Kate knew it was a plant, but I thought it was a rock. As we approached, the 'rock' simply bounced over the car.

--- Page 137 ---

**② Step by step**
The story has a beginning or introduction, a middle or main body and an ending or conclusion. It tells us the events or actions which took place. It also gives us information about people and the place where the story happened.

1. Read the story again and pick out the parts which describe the events and the parts that describe the people and the places.
2. Which tense is used most to describe the events?
3. Look at the notes below. Without looking again at the story, put the notes in the order.
   a. looked at me and laughed
   b. plant bounced over car
   c. noticed large rock
   d. visited friends in America
   e. hit John in the back
   f. explained about plant
   h. drove to mountains

**③ Over to you**
Think of a frightening or funny experience in your own life and write 3 or 4 paragraphs about it. You should write about 300 - 400 words. Notes will help you to write a good narrative.

**Remember that good narratives have:**
**a beginning**
**a middle**
**and an end!!**

Dear Aunt Layla,
How can you help me to change my behaviour? Everybody says I'm a 'baddie'. I think I'm generous and I share with my friends what I have. I help my younger brother with his homework although I sometimes leave school early when I can. I try hard to be on time, yet I seem to be late for everything. I tell jokes that aren't funny. I gossip and criticise and I can't keep secrets. I talk too much when I'm with friends and they call me a chatterbox. I'm often left alone and it's very boring. How can I get people to like me better?

Yours sincerely,
Baddie

Dear Baddie,
It seems that you have some good points and some bad points. It's good that you know what they are! You can't make people like you, but you can stop doing the things which they don't like. Try to talk less and listen more; say good things about people instead of criticising. You'll soon find that you have lots of friends!

Best wishes,
Aunt Layla

[Musical notes]

**Auld Lang Syne**

(Auld (old) Lang Syne is sung all round the world especially at New Year and other celebrations. You will know the tune and the words in Arabic, but here they are in English. The song talks of the 'old days' and how we should always remember them.)

1. Should old acquaintance be forgot
   And never brought to mind?
   Should old acquaintance be forgot
   And the days of old lang syne?

**Chorus:**
**For old lang syne, my dear,**
**For old lang syne.**
**We'll meet again some other night**
**For old lang syne.**

2. So here's a hand my trusty friend
   And give a hand of thine (yours)
   We'll take a cup of kindness yet
   For old lang syne.

**CHAPTER NINE: AGATHA CHRISTIE**

**SECTION ONE: READING**

**① Agatha Christie's Life**
**A.**
1. What is a detective story?
2. What famous detective story writers do you know?

**B. Agatha Christie is a world famous writer. Perhaps you have read some of her books - even in Arabic! Here, we learn more about her life. Read quickly to answer the questions.**

**How did Agatha get her knowledge of poisons?**

Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was born and brought up in Torquay in the South of England. She was educated at home. In 1914 she married Archibald Christie, but her marriage broke up in 1926. In 1930 she married the archaeologist Max Mallowan whom she accompanied on his excavations of sites in Syria and Iraq. During the First World War, she worked in a hospital pharmacy. That was to be useful when she started writing detective stories.

**What was the title of her first detective story?**

Agatha Christie began to write at the end of the World War when she created Hercule Poirot, the little Belgian detective with the egg-shaped head and the passion for order - the most popular detective since Sherlock Holmes. She introduced Poirot in her first detective story, 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles', which appeared in 1920.

--- Page 142 ---

**Breakfast in Baghdad**

[Image of an elderly woman (Miss Marple) having breakfast on a tray.]

She also created another detective, the elderly Miss Marples. In the next fifty six years, she wrote sixty six detective novels among the best of which are 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd', 'Murder on the Orient Express' and 'Death on the Nile'. She also wrote six romantic novels, two self-portraits, several plays and a book of poem. Her play the 'The Mousetrap' ran continuously in London for more than thirty years.

**What is Agatha Christie known as?**

--- Page 143 ---

Agatha Christie is extremely talented in designing a story that is full of suspense. You want to turn the pages quickly to find out what happens next. She is known throughout the world as the 'Queen of Crime'. Her novels have been translated into every major language, and the money from her books is counted in tens of millions. Most of her novels have been made into films, radio plays and stage plays.

8. Find as many words as you can form the story which would fit in to these 'word families'. Add to the list from your memory.
   a. words describing people
   b. jobs

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. Do you know of another woman writer?
2. What has she written?
3. What kind of books do you like: detective stories, romantic novels, historical novels, science fiction, non-fiction? Give a reason for your answer.
4. Do you want to be a famous writer? Why? Why not?

--- Page 144 ---

**② 'The Truth'**
A. 'The Truth' is part of one of Agatha Christie's detective stories. In this story, Shaintana has been killed and his wife, the young Ann Meredith, has been accused of his murder. Detective Poirot is trying to discover the truth when he is visited by Madame Lorrimer....

**Read quickly to answer the questions.**
**Why did Madame Lorrimer come to Poirot?**

Hercule Poirot sighed and stirred.

'Why did you kill him, Madame?'
'I think you know why, Mr. Poirot.'
'Because he knew something about you - and that something was another murder?'

Mrs. Lorrimer nodded.

'I knew, Madame, that there was only one way of learning the truth - that you yourself might wish to speak.'
'It was clever of you to see that. The loneliness - no one knows what that means unless they have lived, as I have lived, with the knowledge of what I have done.'

--- Page 145 ---

**Why did no one see the murder?**

'How soon did you make up your mind to act, Madame?'

Mrs. Lorrimer hesitated a little.

'It is difficult to remember exactly when the idea came into my mind, she said. 'I had noticed the dagger before going to dinner. When we returned to the dining-room, I picked it up and slipped it into my sleeve. No one saw me. I made sure of that. It was risky, but I considered that it was worth trying. I strolled across the room to the fireplace. Shaintana had fallen asleep. I looked over at the others. They were all watching the card game. I leant over and - and did it -'
'He did not cry out at all?'

[Image of a man lying dead on the floor with a dagger in him, as a woman walks away.]

'No, I think he made a little grunt, it might have been taken for words from a distance.'

**What does Poirot think of Madame Lorrimer's story?**

--- Page 146 ---

'But there is still something, Madame, that I don't understand.'
'Yes?'
'It seems to me that there is something I have missed. You are a woman who considers and weighs everything carefully. You decide that you will run an enormous risk. You run it. And then, not two weeks later you change your mind and come here to confess! Frankly, Madame, that doesn't seem to me to ring true.'

**Why did Madame Lorrimer confess to the murder?**

'Yes, I thought you would think that. The truth is that I had been to see a doctor in Harley Street. he told me what I already suspected. He said that with great care, etc., etc., I might live several years. But I shall not take any great care. I am not that kind of a woman.'

**Why does Madame Lorrimer want to protect Ann Meredith?**

Madame Lorrimer thought for a moment, then continued.

'I am not, after all, a wholly wicked woman. All the time I was thinking - I had not only deprived Shaintana of life (that was done and could not be undone), I had also affected Ann Meredith who had not injured me in any way. She might even be suspected of the crime. That at least I could prevent. Ann Meredith was only a girl. She had the whole of her life in front of her. And then, Mr. Poirot, having these ideas growing in my mind, I knew I was not going to be able to keep silent. This afternoon I rang you up ....'

**What does Poirot think about the murder?**

Minutes passed. At last Poirot said.
'Mrs. Lorrimer, are you sure ... you will tell me the truth, will you

--- Page 147 ---

not? Is it not a fact that you planned the murder beforehand?'

'Certainly not.'

'Then ... then ... oh, you are lying to me ... you must be lying.'
'Really, Mr. Poirot, you forget yourself.'

The young man paced up and down the room. Suddenly he said:
'Either the killing of Shaintana was planned beforehand ... or you did not kill him at all.'

Mrs Lorrimer said sharply:
'I really believe you are mad, Mr. Poirot.'

**Who killed Shaintana?**

'You did not kill Shaintana,' he said. 'I see that now. Harley Street. And little Ann Meredith standing sad and anxious on the pavement - another girl who has gone through life always alone. But one thing I do not see - why are you certain that Ann Meredith did it?
'But I've already told you that I ......'

'Absolutely useless to protest - to lie further to me, Madame. I tell you I know the truth.'

A deep sigh broke from Mrs. Lorrimer. She answered his question quite simply, like a child:

'Because,' she said, 'I saw her.'

**C. Read the passage to answer the following questions.**
1. Why did Madame Lorrimer decide to confess?
2. What made the loneliness worse for Madame Lorrimer?

--- Page 148 ---

3. Why did Poirot ask the question: 'He did not cry out at all?'
4. Why does Poirot find it strange that Madame Lorrimer confesses?
5. What was Madame Lorrimer doing in Harley Street?
6. Why did she decide to 'confess' that day?
7. In what way is Ann Meredith like Madame Lorrimer?
8. Why does Madame Lorrimer say to Poirot: 'You forget yourself.'
9. Say whether these statements are true or false:
   a. This is the first time for Madame Lorrimer to commit murder.
   b. If Madame Lorrimer did not confess it wouldn't be easy to find out the truth.
   c. Madame Lorrimer has a big family.
   d. Madame Lorrimer feels guilty of murder.
   e. Shaintana was killed in his bedroom.
   f. Other people were in the house, but they didn't notice what was happening.
   g. Shaintana said some words before he died.
   h. Poirot discovered that Madame Lorrimer was lying because she was a careful woman.
   i. Madame Lorrimer had a serious disease.
   j. Madame Lorrimer wanted to punish herself for the murder she had done before.

**E. Discuss these questions.**
1. What do you think of:
   a. Madame Lorrimer?
   b. Hercule Poirot?
2. What do you think Madame Lorrimer is going to say next to the detective?
3. How do you think the story will end?

--- Page 149 ---

**SECTION 2: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with words**
**A. Expressions of quantity: a few/few; a little/little**

1. Look at these questions and answers. Can you put them in order from the smallest to the largest quantity?

**How many...?**
a. a few b. many c. all d. few e. some

**How much...?**
a. all b. little c. a little d. some e. much

Which questions and expressions are used with countable nouns and which with uncountable nouns?
The difference between 'few' and 'a few' and 'little' and 'a little' is often confusing.

Look carefully at this example.
'There are **a few** books in the cupboard, you can take one of them.'
'There are **few** books in the cupboard, please don't take any.'

2. Use the table below to make answers which match the questions.

Example: Do students in your school get a lot of homework?
A little, but they always do it well.

| A | B | C |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Do students in your school get a lot of homework? | A few, | a. but I prefer detective stories. |
| 2. Do you read any English novels? | | b. but I prefer reading. |
| 3. Is there much desertification in your area? | | c. but only to people abroad. |
| 4. Do you watch much TV? | A little, | d. but they always do it well. |
| 5. Do you write many letters to people? | | e. although I used to take 4 spoonfuls. |
| 6. Do you take a lot of sugar in you tea? | | f. but people are trying to plant trees to stop it. |

3. Ahmed is not happy about what is happening around him. Complete these sentences to find out what he is complaining about.
   a. It is a pity that .......... people care about the poor.
   b. There are .......... people who are willing to help others, but that's all.
   c. There is .......... hope that I will find a job.
   d. .......... people respect time and punctuality.
   e. There are .......... good drivers on the roads these days.
   f. I have .......... friends left, but most of them have moved away.

--- Page 150 ---

**② Grammar Corner**

**A. Make and Let.**
1. Two bank clerks are comparing their bosses. Look at what they say:

**Ali:** My boss **makes** me come to work at 7 a.m. every day and he doesn't **let** me take more than 3 weeks' holiday a year.
**Zeinab:** Well, my boss **lets** me have 5 weeks' holiday a year, but she often **makes** me work on Fridays.

Look at the words underlined. What is the difference in meaning between 'let' and 'make'? What do you notice about the words that come after 'make' and 'let'?

2. Sayed is talking about himself, his family and his friend Imam. Read what he says carefully then fill in the gaps with the correct form of make or let and another appropriate verb. The first one has been done for you.

   a. My father **lets me watch** TV because I never neglect my lessons.
   b. My cousins's parents are not strict with her, they always .......... her .......... what she wants.
   c. My friend Imam is very kind and .......... me .......... his car every Friday.
   d. The film was so sad that it .......... me ..........
   e. I don't like reading detective stories late at night. They always .......... me .......... frightened.
   f. When I am sick, my mother .......... me .......... sleep in my parents' room because it is cooler.
   g. When I need help, my eldest brother always says, '.......... me .......... you.'

--- Page 151 ---

**B. Conjunctions (Joining words)**
1. Rose has just moved into the girls' boarding house at her new university. She reads the 'rules' that the other girls have made up.

See how many conjunctions you can find. Why are they used?

**HOUSE RULES**

1. You can use the bath **but** you must clean it afterwords.
2. You must clean your own room **and** sweep the yard every day.
3. **Although** there is running water, you must use too much of it **because** the tank will run dry.
4. You must get up every day at 4 a.m., **however**, on Fridays you can stay in bed until 4.30 a.m.
5. **If** you have guests, you can take them to the garden **or** you can use the sitting room on the first floor.
6. You must be back by 9 p.m. **unless** you are visiting relatives.

--- Page 152 ---

2. Now make up a different set of rules for a more friendly hall of residence. Make up sentences using the conjunctions you noted above.

**③ Time for Tenses: Review of Tenses with the Passive voice**

1. Look at these sentences taken from Chapter 7 'The Sweet Smell of Success'.
   a. The company **was founded** in 1975
   b. The scheme **is managed** by the Kenana Sugar Company (KSC).
   c. Kenana **manufactures** sugar cubes and sugar syrups.
   d. The Kenana project **has produced** benefits for the Sudan.

What differences do you notice between sentences a and b, and c and d?
Think about the form of the verb and the subject of the verb.

Complete this sentence by circling the correct word.
Sentences a and b are in the **passive/active** voice.
Sentences c and d are in the **passive/active** voice.

2. Now look at the sentences again. This time we have changed them. What changes have been made?
   a. The company was founded in 1975.
      They founded the company in 1975.
   b. The scheme is managed by the Kenana Sugar Company (KSC).
      Kenana Sugar Company manages the scheme.

--- Page 153 ---

c. Kenana manufactures sugar cubes and sugar syrups.
   Sugar cubes and sugar syrup are manufactured by Kenana.
d. The Kenana project has produced benefits for the Sudan.
   Benefits for the Sudan have been produced by the Kenana project.

3. Now change these sentences into the passive. They are news items are taken from a British newspaper called 'The Independent.'
   1. An infected needle killed a nurse in the South of England.
   2. The government will spend less money on young unemployed people.
   3. They have built a new prison in Nottingham.
   4. Liverpool beat Arsenal at football.
   5. People are giving money to children in Albania.

**SECTION 3: WRITING: Reporting an event**

**① Read this!**
A car owner wrote this account of an accident.
Read it then compare it to the narrative you read in Chapter 8. What are the differences?

At 8 a.m. on Monday March 13, I was driving along Palace Avenue at about 30 m.p.h. There

--- Page 154 ---

was a policeman directing the traffic at the junction between Palace Avenue and Al Baladiya Street. I wanted to turn left into Al Baladiya Street. The policeman stopped the traffic in Palace Avenue and signalled to me to turn left.

As I was turning left, a motorbike came towards me at great speed from Palace Avenue. I put on my brakes, but I could not avoid hitting the motorbike rider. He was injured, but not seriously. Two policemen arrived and took him to hospital.

[Image of a car hitting a motorcycle.]

You will notice that the report includes only the important facts. It gives details (time, place, speed of the car) and actions.

**② Step by Step**
The 'WH-' questions (who, when, where, how, why, what happened first, next etc.) will help you to make sure you have the necessary facts in your report. Of course, you do not need to answer these questions about each part of the event, for example

--- Page 155 ---

we do not know the name of the motorbike rider or exactly when he went to hospital. When we write a report we must decide which details and actions are important and relevant.

Imagine someone wanted to find out if pupils learned more before breakfast than after breakfast. They might want, as part of their study to ask you to write a report on your school day from the time you left the house until breakfast time.

Make a draft of your report by answering the following questions.
1. When did you leave home?
2. Who was with you?
3. How did you get to school?
4. How long did it take you?
5. When did you arrive at school?
6. What was the first thing you did after arriving at school?
7. Describe the things you did from the time you arrived at school until breakfast time: remember the questions who, where, when, how long, how many, what happened.

**③ Over to you**
1. Write the report about your school day in connected sentences.
2. Think of another event you might want to report (an accident you saw, some unusual experience, a fire, a crime being committed etc.) Take time to decide on the 'event' then write a report about it. Your report should be about 300-400 words long.

--- Page 156 ---

**SECTION 4: SPINE CHALLENGE**

[Line of smiley and sad faces.]
'My new neighbour bangs on the wall at all hours.' said the young man to his friend. 'Doesn't that keep you awake at night?' the friend asked. 'No, but it does interfere with my trumpet practice,' he replied.
[Line of smiley and sad faces.]

A Sudanese man lost his friend in the streets of London. He asked a policeman, 'have you seen a Sudanese man pass by?'
'What does he look like,' asked the policeman?
'He's green and...,' said the Sudanese man.
'Oh, don't worry,' said the policeman. 'If he's green we'll soon find him.'

[Image of a boy with a very long shadow.]

--- Page 157 ---

**MY SHADOW**

I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow --
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an Indian-rubber ball,
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.

He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
And can only make a fool of me in very sort of way.
He stays so close behind me, he's a coward you can see;
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.

Rudyard Kipling

- notion = idea
- think shame = be ashamed
- nursie = a nurse or helper who looks after children
- buttercup = a small yellow flower
- arrant = complete, absolute

**CHAPTER TEN: SCIENCE IN ACTION**

**SECTION 1: Reading**

[Image of a submarine on the surface of the water.]

**① Nuclear Power**
**A. Think about these questions.**
1. What are the main types of fuel in Sudan for cars and buses?
2. How many miles can a car travel on one gallon of fuel?
3. In the picture above is a submarine. What is the difference between a submarine and an ordinary ship?

**B. Read quickly to answer the questions.**

**Why can this submarine go for several years without stopping for fuel?**

--- Page 159 ---

Can you imagine driving a car for several years without stopping once to get petrol? Can you imagine that after driving the car for several years, it would still have enough fuel in the tank to go on running for several more years? There is no such car today, but someday there may be one! Read on to find out how this might be possible.

The submarine in the picture is called the **Nautilus**. It has travelled many thousands of miles sometimes on the water and sometimes under the water - without stopping for fuel!

The Nautilus does not have ordinary oil-burning engines in it. It is run by atomic or nuclear power. One pound of nuclear fuel can do the work of millions of pounds of coal or oil. That is why the submarine can go so far without stopping for fuel. Nuclear-powered ships will soon replace many of the present ocean liners.

The new ships will be able to travel all around the world without re-fuelling.

**What is the main source of energy in coal, oil and gas?**

How is nuclear power produced? We read and hear about energy from the sun. The sun's energy is stored in coal, oil and gas. Energy or power is also produced using the great power of fast-flowing water which is held back by a dam. This is called hydro-electric power. Nuclear energy is produced from the atom - the very very small part of every object. A great amount of energy is used to keep the different parts of the atom together. When scientists split the atom, energy is set free and can be used. (Perhaps your science teacher will explain how nuclear power works!)

--- Page 160 ---

**What makes the hands of a clock or a watch shine in the dark?**

In a small way, nuclear energy has been used in the home for many years. An alarm clock or a watch which has hands and numbers that can be seen in the dark are using nuclear power to light up the hand and numbers. If you have ever used such a watch, you have used nuclear power!

[Image of a clock face with glowing hands.]

Although there are now many ways of using nuclear power, the power we get from atoms will be used even more in the years to come. There is a great future for all of mankind if we learn to use nuclear power properly.

**C. Read the passage again carefully and answer these questions.**
1. Why is the Nautilus not run by oil?
2. What will atom-powered ships be able to do?
3. Explain how we get energy from a) coal b) water c) the atom
4. In what ways is nuclear power used at home?

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. Make a list of things in your house, school and town which use a) energy from the sun b) nuclear energy c) hydro-electric power
2. List the advantages and disadvantages of each of these sources of power.

--- Page 161 ---

[Image of solar panels angled towards the sun.]

**② Alternative Energy**
**A. Think about these questions.**
1. Make a list of all of the sources of energy or power that you know of.
2. Put the list in order with the most expensive first and the least expensive last.
3. Do you know of any energy source which costs nothing?!

**B. Read quickly to answer the questions.**

**Why is energy important in our lives?**

Energy is often taken for granted. Sometimes we only appreciate electricity when there is a power cut! We suddenly cannot see or make a cup of tea or watch television.

--- Page 162 ---

Energy is such an important part of our lives. We use it to travel to school or work. When we walk we burn up the energy stored in our bodies and when we travel by car, the engine burns petrol or diesel for energy. Almost everything we do requires energy - even thinking!

**How can people in rural areas solve the power problem?**

Many people, of course live in small villages and areas where there is no electricity, gas or petrol. With no source of energy, standards of living can be quite low. But solutions to this problem can be found in nature. The sun, the wind, water and waste products can be used as energy.

**What is renewable energy?**

There are two main types of fuel: renewable and non-renewable. Non-renewable means that there is only a certain amount of fuel. When that amount of fuel is finished, there will be no more for people to use. This kind of non-renewable fuel comes from coal, gas and oil. Some day, the coal, gas and oil will run out.

However, the sun shines, the wind blows, rivers run and animal and plant waste is produced continually as part of the earth's natural cycle. If we can learn to use these things to produce energy, we can be sure of a power supply in the future. Many countries now consider renewable energy as an important source of power. Since the sun, the wind and animal waste are available even in rural areas, these sources can make a big difference in the life of the people living in these areas.

**How can we get electricity from the sun?**

--- Page 163 ---

The sun is very powerful. Energy from the sun reaches the earth in the form of light and heat. This heat can be collected in special cells and used as a source of power called **solar power**. Energy from the sun can also be made into electricity.

In many developing countries solar power is providing power to homes, hospitals and health centres. Solar power can also provide power for pumping water to remote places where clean water supplies are not available. Perhaps you yourself have a solar powered calculator!

**Why are wind pumps better than diesel pumps?**

Making use of energy from the wind is not a modern idea. For many centuries windmills have been used to take energy power which is in the wind as it moves. Windmills have been used to grind grain and pump water. Wind power is being used in several developing countries as a cheap way of providing energy to pump water for people, animals and crops.

[Image of a traditional windmill.]

--- Page 164 ---

**What is biogas?**

In many developing countries animal dung is not wasted, but can be used to provide a cheap source of energy. If animal dung or plant waste is stored in an airtight container, germs attack it and break it down producing gas. This is called biogas. The gas is collected and can be used for cooking, heating water and lighting.

**C. Read the passage again carefully and answer these questions.**
1. What are the different sources of energy available for people in rural areas?
2. In what ways has solar energy affected people in rural areas?
3. Why is renewable energy better in many ways than non-renewable energy?
4. How is biogas produced?

**D. Discuss these questions.**
1. 'With no source of energy, standards of living can be quite low.' Do you agree? Give reasons for your answer.
2. Find out about and then make a list of renewable energy being used in your area.
3. Which sources of renewable energy would be best for your area? Why?

**SECTION 3: EXPLORING LANGUAGE**

**① Working with Words**
**A. Vocabulary building**
1. Study these words from the text in section one. Use them to fill in the spaces below.

**3. Time for Tenses: Revision**
Practising tenses one by one is quite easy. It is more difficult to decide which tense to use in a passage or when you are writing.

1. Read the story and choose the tense of the verb in brackets which you think fits best.

A man went into a shop and bought a small bird. He (want) to teach the bird to talk. After a few days, the bird (not/talk), so the man (go) back to the shop. The shopkeeper (say), 'If you (buy)

--- Page 169 ---

a mirror, the bird (look) into the mirror and it (want) to talk to itself. The man (take) the mirror home and (put) it in the bird cage. The bird (look) in the mirror, but (not/talk), so the man (return) to the shop.
'The bird (look) in the mirror for 3 days, but still (not/talk),' he (say) angrily.
'OK,' (say) the shopkeeper, 'Now you (have to) buy a ladder. The bird (run) up the ladder, (look) in the mirror and then it (speak).

While the man (buy) the ladder, the shopkeeper cried, 'Ah, (Just/remember) something. Birds also (like) bells. My pet bird always (ring) a bell before he (speak). He (do) that for years and years. The man also (pay) for a bell. He (give) the ladder and the bell to the bird, but after a few days, the bird (die). The man (take) the ladder and the mirror and the bell back to the shop and (tell) the shopkeeper what (happen).
'Oh, dear,' (say) the shopkeeper, 'all that trouble and not a single word.'
'Oh no,' interrupt the man. 'Just before it (die), the bird (call) out "Please (give) me some food!"

**SECTION 4: WRITING: ARGUMENTATIVE**

**① Read this!**
Read the text below. Do you agree with the ideas? Do you think the text was written and/or written and spoken?

**POWER TO THE PEOPLE!**
Yes! Power to the people - power for the people and by the people. I am not making a political statement, but I'm talking

--- Page 170 ---

about the power we need to light our homes, cook our food, move from one place to another. We must wake up to the fact that traditional power sources are decreasing. We need to find alternatives before we are left in the dark!

Scientists have shown that the supplies of oil, gas and coal are limited. It takes thousands of years to produce such fuels and the human population is so large that these supplies are being used up. We cannot bury our heads in the sand, we must use the resources of wind, sun and water which are all around us everyday to generate the power we need.

Already in Sudan water pumps are being used in the river Nile using the energy that comes from the movement of the river. Some people in Sudan also use solar panels and generate enough electricity to keep small machines working. In Europe people have been using windmills for centuries as free energy supplies to produce flour from grain.

But why are we so slow to make the most of these things? Yes, there are costs involved: solar panels are expensive, river-powered pumps need repairs. Also we must think not only of the energy we need, but also of the energy that future generations will need. We do not want our children and grandchildren to be living in the 'dark ages'! We need to stop burning up fuel which cannot be renewed and use alternative sources of energy to make sure that the people now and the generations to come have all the power they need.

2. Read the passage again and answer these questions.
   1. What do you think the writer was trying to do in each paragraph?
   2. How did the writer do these things? What ideas, expressions did he use?
   3. What parts of the passage a) did you find funny b) made you

--- Page 171 ---

think c) made you feel angry/ashamed/sad/hopeful

**② Step by Step**
We have already studied argumentative essays in Chapter 5. Look again at the writing section of that chapter.

Here we are going to think about the beginning and the end of an argumentative essay. In this kind of writing, the beginning and the end are very important because these are the parts people remember most! When arguing or trying to persuade, therefore we should begin and end with a 'punch' - with strong or clever or amusing language.

Write the first sentence and the last sentence of an argumentative essay on these topics.
1. Too much money is spent on entertainment.
2. Medicine is more expensive and less useful than traditional cures.
3. All people should be free to travel to any country in the world without needing a visa.

Read out your sentences and let your friends decide how big a 'punch' they have!

**③ Over to you**
Choose one of the topics in 2 above and write an essay of about 300 words. Remember to have a good beginning and ending and to include evidence and good arguments and ideas to support your opinion. (See Chapter 5). When you have finished, read your essay to the class so that everyone can discuss the topic.

--- Page 172 ---

**SECTION 4: SPINE CHALLENGE**

**? Can you explain this story???**

This is a story about a surgeon - a doctor who performs operations in a hospital.

One day a surgeon and his son were driving from the city where they worked to their home in the country. The surgeon had been working very hard so he tired and in a hurry to get home. As he was about to overtake a lorry, the lorry pulled out in front of him very suddenly. The surgeon braked, but was not able to avoid crashing into the lorry. Sadly, the surgeon was killed instantly. The boy was badly injured and taken to hospital as he needed an operation. The surgeon came into the room, looked at the boy and said, 'I can't operate on this boy - he's my son!'
