Introduction
Dear Students:
This new English language curriculum, SMILE (Sudan Modern Integrated
Learning of English), is specially tailored to Sudanese pupils in general
education and it is intended to replace the SPINE Curriculum.
The introduction of English language learning in the Intermediate level
grades aims to prepare Sudanese pupils to participate productively in the
21st century. Pupils will become aware of the significance of English as an
international means of knowledge and communication.
The SMILE series is comprised of the following components:

A Pupil's Book.

An Activity Book.

A Teacher's Book.

CD/ Mp3s.

Posters/Flashcards.
The SMILE series is a pupil-centered, standards-based curriculum. It targets
phonics and makes use of cross-curricular topics and enjoyable learning
activities to motivate younger learners.
The SMILE Curriculum intends to develop a positive attitude towards
English as a foreign language and teaches the four language skills
(listening, speaking, reading and writing).
SMILE textbooks consist of eight units. Every unit has eight lessons.
Lesson 8 is a revision of the previous lessons of the unit. Most units include
two recordings; these are of dialogues, chants and/or stories. Most units also
include a story. Unit 8 revises learning from previous units.
We hope that the SMILE Curriculum will be accessible to pupils, teachers,
supervisors and parents.
With best regards,
The Writes

Look at the pictures. What do you know about the subjects?
A
Chemistry
B
Biology
C
Physics

Read the text. Why do we study science?
At school, science usually consists of Chemistry, Physics and Biology, but science is much more
than these. Understanding science makes life easier. Scientists often do experiments to check
their ideas and make new discoveries. We study science because it helps us to learn about the
world around us.
Do you know these facts?
.
Ice melts when you heat it.
.
.
.
Salt dissolves when you put it in water.
Plants die if they don't get enough water.
Water boils at 100 degrees centigrade.
Different things fall to the ground at the same speed.

• Alexander Bell's
mother and wife
were deaf so he was
interested in sound.
Other scientists were
trying to send sound
over long distances,
but many people
think the telephone
was invented by
Alexander Bell.
• Louis Pasteur made two
important discoveries.
The first one is boiling
liquids like milk.
Bacteria in the milk
is killed by the heat.
The other discovery
is vaccinations.
People are protected
against diseases by
vaccinations.
• Marie Curie was the
first woman to win
the Nobel Prize for
Physics for her work
on radiation. Eight
years later, in 1911.
she won another
Nobel Prize. Sadly,
she was killed by
radiation and died
in 1934.
• Isaac Newton
was one of the
greatest scientists
ever. Gravity was
discovered by him
and an important
kind of maths was
invented by him,
too. He was born in
England and lived
about 300 years ago.

Bones Facts
• All the bones in the body are called the skeleton.
• When people are born they have 270 bones, but adults only
have 206 bones! This is because our bones join together.
• Some bones protect the body. The bones of the head
protect the brain and the ribs protect the heart.
• Some bones, for example those in our legs, help us move
around and support our muscles.
• Around 70 percent of our bones are made of hard
materials like calcium. If your body doesn't have enough
calcium, your bones will be weaker.
• Our bones come together in special places that are called
joints. Inside joints there is a material that stops the bones
from knocking together.
• Our smallest bones are in the ear.

In 1974, a thirty-year-old architect and teacher thought of an idea that changed the world of
games. He called his invention the 'Magic Cube'. At first, he used the cube to teach his students
the ideas of space and location. These are ideas about size, shape and the location of objects to
each other. Later Erno Rubik sold his cube as a toy. The first cubes were sold in Hungary in 1977.
Three years later, the cube was called Rubik's Cube. Since then Rubik has sold more than 400
million cubes around the world. As Erno Rubik said, "If you look, you will find puzzles around you.
If you work hard, you will solve them."

Bacteria are very small living things. They
are found in the air, in food and in our
bodies. Some bacteria in our bodies help
us to take the good things from our food.
These help us to grow stronger.
However, some bacteria can give us illnesses and diseases. Bacteria in
our mouths can make us ill if we don't brush our teeth. Food like meat
or milk can sometimes have dangerous bacteria in it. If we cook the
meat or boil the milk correctly, we can kill the bacteria.
(3)
Bacteria can move from person to person very quickly. It is important
to wash our hands before we eat, and to cover our mouths when we
cough. When you are ill, you should stay away from other people.

eat the gazelle, and the fox
can eat the rabbit."
The lion jumped up and
angrily hit the hyena with one
of his strong paws. The hyena
immediately dropped dead.
The lion turned to the fox.
"The hyena didn't know how
to divide the food fairly. Do
you know how to?"

People have used sand to make art for thousands of years. It's easy to do, and it isn't usually
very expensive. You can make sculptures or build things with sand. When sand is painted,
you can make beautiful sand pictures. You can do sand drawings with your fingers, and
make wonderful patterns in a few minutes. However, sand art doesn't usually last very long.
Sculptures are washed away by water, or they are blown away by the wind.
Some people think there is also a natural kind of sand art. Beautiful sand dunes are
made by the wind in deserts, and amazing patterns and tracks are left on the surface of
the sand by animals like snakes and lizards which have crossed the desert.

arriving on the island, I was walking on the beach one day when I saw some tracks. I saw some
pirates and I was very frightened. Then I saw another man. He was running away so I saved him.

Ibrahim El-Salahi
Tate Plodem Gallery, London (2013)
Ibrahim El-Salahi is a famous Sudanese artist. His art
has been shown in art galleries across Africa, Europe,
North America and the Middle East. Many people think he
is the most talented modern African artist in the world.
His art is influenced by Arabic calligraphy and Sudanese
traditions.
"I was born in Omdruman in 1930. In 1949, I studied
painting at the Gordon Memorial College in Khartoum. My
first paintings were shown at an art gallery in Khartoum.
From 1954 to 1957, I studied painting and calligraphy in
London. After that, I studied photography in New York.
After my studies, I went home to Sudan. I was known as one of the painters in the
'Khartoum School'. I then moved to Qatar and lived there for 21 years. I now live
in the UK.
I have spent time in different countries but my first and most important lessons in
painting were in the Khalwa. When I was a young boy, I used to paint the wooden
slates for children to write the verses of the Holy Quran."

world's most amazing animals such as kangaroos and koalas.
② This is the largest island in the world, but it only has a population of 58,000 people. That's
fewer people than many cities in other countries! The capital city is Nuuk, and more than 25%
of the people live there. 85% of the island is covered in snow and ice, and it gets very cold in

Welcoming Sudan
People in Sudan are famous for lots of things. One of these is
how friendly they are to tourists and people from other countries.
When you visit Sudan, you will find generous hospitality from local
people. People from overseas are often surprised when someone
wants to pay for them on a bus, or invites them to eat a meal in a
café or restaurant.
People often invite tourists to come to their home, and they give
them food and a place to stay. Sometimes, someone may slaughter
a sheep or goat and prepare a delicious meal. There are stories of
Sudanese people who have killed their only animal. Many visitors
to Sudan decide to return again and again to visit old friends, and
because they want to make new ones.

The Arab Empire began around the year
622, and by 750 it stretched from the
Indian border across North Africa and
into Spain. Trade helped the empire to
grow. Merchants travelled along the Silk
Road to markets. Today, souqs are known
as places where you can buy things such
as jewellery, dates and coffee.
The most famous Arab traveller was Ibn Battuta. He
started travelling in 1325, when he went on the Hajj to
Makkah. He spent the next 29 years travelling all over the
empire and to other countries. He visited cities in Yemen,
sailed across the Red Sea to Somalia, and travelled north
to Turkey. He wrote a book about his adventures and all
of the amazing places which he visited.

ingredients is a kind of butter which is made
from cocoa beans. These beans grow in South
America and here in Africa.
The first people to use cocoa beans were
the Aztecs. In their language there is a word:
xocoatil. In the 16th century, the Spanish
brought cocoa beans to Europe. The beans
were mixed with sugar to make chocolate. Some
people also use the beans to make a hot drink.

of caffeine. You find caffeine in coffee. However,

In some parts of Sudan, it is difficult to grow crops. Sometimes the soil is not very good and in some
places, there isn't enough water. However, in many parts of Sudan it is not difficult to grow crops.
In fact, Sudan often has enough food to export to its neighbours such as Egypt, Chad and Eritrea.
The main food products from Sudan are crops such as sorghum, which is often used to make bread;
seeds from sesame and sunflowers, which are used to make cooking oil; and fruit such as bananas,
mangoes and lemons.
Three-quarters of Sudan's population have jobs in agriculture. One reason why people in Sudan can
grow different crops is the weather - the long summer, a rainy season and a dry winter.

is important for your bones.
• Grain: Examples of grains are rice and bread.
• Meat and fish: This group is important for protein.
• Vegetables and fruit: This group gives us
minerals and vitamins.
• Fat and sugar: Our bodies only need a little fat

For thousands of years people have kept bees for their honey. Beekeepers build plastic boxes or
hives - and put these in gardens and fields. There are three kinds of bee in each hive: one king,
thousands of male bees, and thousands of female workers. In the summer, there are around 3,000
bees in one hive! The workers have many jobs. They clean, they produce vitamins, they protect
the hive, and they collect nectar to make honey. When a bee finds good nectar, it waves its wings
to show other bees where to go. When beekeepers collect the honey from the hives, they wear
special clothing so the bees don't sting them. Sometimes the king and large numbers of bees look
for food. When this happens, it can be dangerous.

To be healthy, we need to have a healthy diet, drink lots of water and do exercise. We also need to
have healthy habits. In Islam, praying, fasting and behaving correctly are important. We shouldn't
steal, hurt people or lie. When we do something wrong, such as breaking a window, we mustn't
blame others.
It is also important to help other people. For example, if you see an old person with a heavy bag,
you should stop and help them. If you are on a bus and an old person gets on, give your seat to
them so they can sit down. We should also help people who are poorer or less fortunate than us.

Adverts can help people to sell their products. Adverts on TV are the most popular kind because
more people see them. However, it's the most expensive way to advertise. There are also adverts
on the radio, in magazines, and on billboards along the side of a road or on big buildings.
Companies are using other ways to sell their products. For example, football teams now have
the names of companies on their shirts. This is becoming more popular. Some companies pay
supermarkets and shops to show their products in places where most people can see them easily,
for example, near the shop doors. This is probably the cheapest way to advertise.

In 1848, an American carpenter found gold in a river near the
mountains in California. In 1849, the famous California gold rush
started. That year about 90,000 people arrived to look for gold. They
used hand tools to break up rocks, and they sifted the small stones in
the rivers hoping to find pieces of gold. Their lives were very hard.
When the gold rush started, San Francisco had a population of
1,000. By 1852, the population was more than 30,000. Some people
made money by opening shops where the miners could buy the tools
and other things they needed to survive. By 1855, most of the gold
was found, and the gold rush was over.

are made of ebony, silver, gold or leather. These days, there are many products from India and
China including clothing, sheets and fabrics, cooking items, electronics and many other things
made from plastic.
Omdurman Market is made up of many smaller markets. There is a fruit market, furniture market,
handicrafts market and a clothing market. The number of stalls with things for sale is increasing. It
is even busier than it was in the past. Sometimes, especially before Eid, there are so many people
shopping that it's impossible to walk around. People have to wait in long queues to get the things
that they want or need to buy.

"How long will it take to get to the market?" The boy answered, "If you go quickly, it will take you a
long time, but if you go slowly you will get there quickly." The farmer thought the boy was laughing
at him, which made him very angry. He started to walk quickly. After two hours, the farmer, who
was now tired, stopped to rest. He looked at the baskets, which were now empty, and shouted,
"Where are my oranges?" It was getting dark when he finished picking them up. "Why didn't I

to study there.
Over the years more departments were added, and in 1951 the college became the University
College of Khartoum. With the independence of Sudan in 1956, the name was changed again to
the University of Khartoum.
Many famous people have studied at the University of Khartoum. They include many prime

clever. However, we now know there are different learning difficulties.
Some children have problems with words and find reading and writing very hard. Other children
have problems with numbers or remembering things. This doesn't mean these children are stupid or
lazy, it just means that their brains don't see things in the same way as other people's.
There are some famous people around the world who have these problems. For example, Albert
Einstein and Mohammed Ali both had problems with reading. And Bill Gates, who started the

People and animals have a complex relationship. We use animals such as dogs, oxen and
chickens for hunting, farming and for food. There are other animals that we kill because we think
they are dangerous. However, we need to be careful. Animals like scorpions are often useful
because they eat small animals like mice and rats. If we kill scorpions, then there will be more
mice and they will destroy crops and eat our food.
It is also important to protect animals and their habitats. Animals such as pandas in China are not
in danger because people kill them, but because we destroy the places they live. Other animals,
like the rhinos in Africa, are under threat from hunting. People must remember that we share the
planet with animals.

Stay Fit and Healthy!
Try a New Sport!
There are sports for everybody. You can do some sports alone such as
swimming or running, or you can join a club and do these sports with
friends. Other sports, like football or Shadat, are played in teams.
If you don't like sweating and getting hot and tired, try archery or yoga
Yes, yoga is a sport! People don't always want to compete, or try to be
stronger or faster.
For some sports, you need equipment which costs money For example,
it's difficult to sail without a boat, or if you don't live near a river or a lake.
However, for some sports you don't really need anything. Abebe Bikila
didn't wear shoes when he won a gold medal at the 1960 Olympic Games!

One of the most important discoveries of the last 150 years was the
discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming. At the time, many people
died from diseases which were caused by bacteria. Penicillin cured these
diseases by killing the bacteria.
Fleming discovered penicillin by accident. He was doing
some experiments in a science laboratory where he
worked. One Friday evening he left a glass dish on a
table. When he came into work on Monday morning he
discovered a mould which was growing in the dish. He saw
that it was killing the bacteria. Fleming was very interested,
and so he did some more experiments. In 1945, Fleming
won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for a discovery which has
now saved many lives.

and sailed across the Indian Ocean and then back to the coast of East Africa around 500 years
before the first Europeans. Another sailor, Ibn Majid was known as the 'Lion of the Seas'. He
helped the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama sail around Africa and to India in 1498.
