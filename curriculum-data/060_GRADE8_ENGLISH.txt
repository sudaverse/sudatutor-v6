Introduction:
Dear Pupils:
This new English language curriculum, SMILE (Sudan Modern Integrated
Learning of English), is specially tailored to Sudanese pupils in general
education and it is intended to replace the SPINE Curriculum.
The introduction of English language learning in the Intermediate level
grades aims to prepare Sudanese pupils to participate productively in the
21st century. Pupils will become aware of the significance of English as an
international means of knowledge and communication.
The SMILE series is comprised of the following components:

A Pupil's Book.

An Activity Book.

A Teacher's Book.

CD/ Mp3s.

Posters/ Flashcards.
The SMILE series is a pupil-centered, standards-based curriculum. It targets
phonics and makes use of cross-curricular topics and enjoyable learning
activities to motivate younger learners.
The SMILE Curriculum intends to develop a positive attitude towards
English as a foreign language and teaches the four language skills
(listening, speaking, reading and writing).
SMILE textbooks consist of eight units. Every unit has eight lessons.
Lesson 8 is a revision of the previous lessons of the unit. Most units include
two recordings; these are of dialogues, chants and/or stories. Most units also
include a story. Unit 8 revises learning from previous units.
We hope that the SMILE Curriculum will be accessible to pupils, teachers,
supervisors and parents.
With best regards,
The Writers

A Forest fires are sometimes started by lightning. Lightning can hit a tree and start a fire.
These forest fires can last a long time and burn down lots of trees. When the fire is near a
town, people have to leave their homes and go somewhere safe.
Ⓑ Every year there are more than 1,000 tornadoes in the USA. A tornado is a very strong
wind. It moves round and round very quickly but goes slowly from one place to another.
Most tornadoes only last for about ten minutes, but they do a lot of damage to houses and
buildings as well as plants and trees.

Save the animals
Around the world many different animals are in danger. Pandas
in China, white rhinos and a type of gazelle in Africa are in
danger.
White rhinos are in danger from people who hunt them for their horns. They
sell the horns for lots of money.
The slender-horned gazelle are also hunted, but not for their horns. They are
hunted for meat.
Another problem is that people are cutting down the forests where animals
live. Pandas and other animals are losing their homes and their food.

The world is a dangerous place. Floods, droughts and storms happen all around the world.
However, for many animals the biggest danger is people. We hunt animals for their meat
and their horns. We cut down trees, build houses and roads and we make the rivers and air
dirty with smoke and rubbish.
There is only one world. It's important that we think about the environment for us and for all
the other animals on the planet.

Read the text. Answer the questions.
Hand washing is important because it helps you to stay healthy. A simple thing like washing
your hands after you go to the toilet can keep you safe. You should also wash your hands
before you eat or when they are dirty. It is easy for bacteria to go from your hands to your
mouth and make you ill. Washing your hands can stop you from getting ill with a sore
stomach or the runs.

Read the text. What is it about?
It is important to have a good diet to stay healthy. But it is not always easy.
Fresh food is healthier than canned food. People who live on a farm can usually eat lots
of fresh food like eggs, fruit and vegetables. But the food in cities is not always as fresh as
the food from villages where it is grown. It has often travelled a long way. Often this food is
canned or frozen.
Junk food like crisps, sweets and chocolate is not good for you. You can eat junk food
sometimes, but you should not eat too much of it.

the ceiling and windows are made of wood.
The palace is now a museum and has lots of things for visitors to see including coins,

Bahri.
It is a modern building and is made from modern building materials. One important thing
is the way it gets energy. It uses special panels that get energy from the sun. These are
called solar panels and are good for the environment.

I'm having a great time here in Sudan.
Last week, we went to the city of
El-Fasher in Darfur. We stayed there
for one night in a hotel. The next day,
we drove into the Marra Mountains
in a four-wheel drive car. You can
see a picture of the mountains on the
front of this postcard. I saw some wild
sheep and some beautiful butterflies.
The people live in beautiful huts which

The road from Khartoum to Port Sudan goes north. You
can see some interesting old pyramids as you travel. These
pyramids were built two thousand five hundred years ago!
The people who lived here were part of a very big kingdom,
called the Kingdom of Kush.
The most important city in the kingdom was Meroë. There
were a lot of big farms in the kingdom and these farms
made money for the city. The people there also knew how
to make metal tools.
But now, the city of Meroë has gone. There are only some
very old pyramids now. It is a place where many tourists go
Sudanese tourists and people from other countries.

Hi Ben,
It is my last few weeks in Sudan. I'm very sad because it's an
amazing country. Today, we went to Omdurman again. It's on the
west bank of the River Nile opposite Khartoum. We've been there
lots of times but I really like it. We went to see the Abdelqayom Gate
and the Khalifa's House. You can take lots of photographs there. We
also visited the Mahdi's Tomb where Mohammed Ahmed Al Mahdi
is buried, but we didn't go inside. In the afternoon, we visited the
market. It was so busy! My mum bought some jewellery and my dad
bought a painting.

I've really enjoyed my wonderful trip to Sudan and we've done lots of things. I went

we didn't go to Dinder National Park. Next time! Yesterday we went shopping in

In villages and in the country, houses are often made of traditional local materials because they
are cheap. Some houses in Sudan and other countries in Africa are made of the hair of animals
like camels and goats. These houses are easy to move from place to place.

Animals like pandas, gorillas and rhinos are in danger. People are cutting down forests.
If we cut down all the trees, animals like pandas and gorillas won't have a place to live.
There are now only 1,800 giant pandas and 800 mountain gorillas in the wild. Another
problem is hunting. Rhinos are hunted for their horns. Many animals will be extinct if we
don't do something to protect them.
Happily, there are things that we can do to save animals in danger. We can protect
the forests where animals live, and we can make national parks. We can stop hunting
animals that are in danger. There were only 100 white rhinos in Africa, but now there
are 20,000. If we do these things, future generations will see and enjoy these animals.

Although animals are important in our life, some animals are dangerous. Sharks look dangerous
because they have sharp teeth. We sometimes hear stories of them killing people but they are

scorpions.
A scorpion can sting and hurt us and sometimes it can kill us. Locusts can eat a field of plants in
minutes. When this happens lots of people can die because there is not enough food. Some spiders
can kill us when they bite. However, the most dangerous animal is the mosquito. This insect can give
us malaria and about a million people die every year from this disease.

Our solar system is like an egg. It consists of the sun, which is a star, and nine planets. One of
these is our planet, the Earth. The closest planet to the sun is Mercury, which is also the smallest
planet. The Earth is the third planet from the sun and almost 150 million kilometres away from it.
We don't get too cold or too hot. The biggest planet is Jupiter. It has 63 moons. Saturn is famous
for its rings of ice. Venus is between the Earth and Mercury, and we find Mars between the Earth
and Jupiter. Uranus is the 7th planet and is the coldest planet in our solar system. Pluto is the
most distant planet from the sun. It takes 164 Earth years for Neptune to orbit the sun once.

The moon, the sun and the stars have always interested
people. For thousands of years we used the sun, the moon
and the stars to help us tell the time and to find our way
across the seas.
The Arab and Muslim world was famous for astronomy, and
there were observatories in many cities. Muslim Persian
scientists and astronomers like Al-Battani, Al-Khwarizmi,
Ibn Al-Haytham and Omar Khayyam studied the stars and
planets, and made important discoveries in astronomy. Later,
their discoveries helped scientists in Europe. Copernicus
(1473-1543) was the first person to say the sun was
the centre of the solar system and to say that the planets
orbited it. Galileo (1564 – 1642) is often called the inventor
of the telescope.

B This is at the centre of our solar system. It is 4.6 billion years old. The surface temperature is
5,500°C – that is very hot! It takes 8 minutes for light from there to reach us because we are
150 million kilometres away.
This is the only planet in the solar system with life. The air here consists of 78 percent nitrogen
and 21 percent oxygen. It is often called the 'Blue Planet'. 70 percent of the surface is covered
with water. In the past, people thought this planet was the centre of the solar system.

only spend six months here because
there's no gravity in space. If we
stay here longer, our muscles and
bones will become weak. We do
exercise for two hours every day. We
spend a lot of our time cleaning the
station because dust can damage the
equipment. Most of our food is in
packets and we add water before we
eat it. Occasionally we get fresh fruit
and it's always always delicious!
② I've never been to the moon, but I think people will
live there in the future. We'll need special places to live
because there's no oxygen. We'll also need to grow food
and find water. People will need to find ways to stay fit and
healthy too.

Al-Biruni was one of the most
famous Muslim scientists. He was
born in 973 AD and died at the age
of 75. He wrote more than 140
books and half of these were about
mathematics or astronomy. He did
many experiments and collected
information about eclipses. Much
of this information was used by
astronomers hundreds of years later.

In 1983 Sally Ride became the first
American woman in space. She was
born in 1951 and she studied science
at university. In 1978 she joined NASA
and trained for a year to become an
astronaut. She worked in two missions
and spent more than 300 hours in
space. In 2001 she started her own
company trying to interest girls in
science, maths and technology.

A player has to throw the Shileil.
Shileil
You play Shileil on a night with a bright moon. You make a circle on the ground and then a player
has to throw the Shileil (a bone) and shout, “Where's the Shileil?” The other players answer, “The
lion ate the Shileil”, and they try to find the Shileil. Players ask and answer the same question
about different animals. When a player finds the Shileil, they try to get to the circle to win the
game.

People and animals have a complex relationship. We use animals such as dogs, oxen and
chickens for hunting, farming and for food. There are other animals that we kill because we think
they are dangerous. However, we need to be careful. Animals like scorpions are often useful
because they eat small animals like mice and rats. If we kill scorpions, then there will be more
mice and they will destroy crops and eat our food.
It is also important to protect animals and their habitats. Animals such as pandas in China are not
in danger because people kill them, but because we destroy the places they live. Other animals,
like the rhinos in Africa, are under threat from hunting. People must remember that we share the
planet with animals.
