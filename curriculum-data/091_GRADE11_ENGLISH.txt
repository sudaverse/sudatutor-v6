CHAPTER ONE : Family Society and Community

People nowadays are very concerned about improving the lives of their family, society and community. In this chapter we will be looking at different ways of doing this.

[Image of three women: one harvesting plants, one sorting grains, and one using a sewing machine.]

Section I : Reading I

(A) Read this passage quickly then complete this sentence in your own words :-
"This passage is about .................."

Income Generators

Family income generating activities are becoming very popular nowadays. The government is giving funds to help families improve their income. Ministries of Social Welfare all over the country are starting a programme called the "Productive Families" programme. They offer training courses to people with low incomes to learn certain job skills. They give loans to families to start their own businesses. They also employ social workers to solve the different problems which the families might face.

It is reported that many families have benefited from this programme. Many have managed to repay the loans and make good profits. In addition, they now have a regular income and a better life. There are many success stories like that of Amna Hamid, which we can now look at.

[Page 7]

B. Read the passage again then answer the questions.
1. Are income generating activities popular or unpopular ? Why / Why not?
2. Where does most of the help come from?
3. What kind of help do ministries give to families?
4. How have families made use of these activities?

C. Read the passage below and as soon as you can complete this sentence :
Amna needed more money because she was a .................... and she .................... money.

A Success Story

Amna Hamid is a widow living in Umbadda West of Omdurman. She has five children of school age. She used to work for three hours a day as a cleaner in a nearby factory and spend the rest of the day doing housework and selling peanuts to children in the neighbourhood. She earned very little money. She could hardly afford to pay for all the household expenses, let alone pay school fees for her children.

[Image of five rabbits.]

A social worker visited the family and encouraged Amna to join in the "Productive Families" programme. She was given a loan to start a small business of rabbit breeding. She received training on how to feed rabbits and keep them healthy. She was supplied with two pairs of a good breed of rabbits.

A few months later, the rabbits multiplied and Amna had a good stock ready for marketing. Again she joined another short programme on marketing where she received training on how to convince people to buy her

[Page 8]

products and on how to keep accounts.

Later, Amna's business flourished and she had many customers. As a result of her efforts, rabbit meat became very popular and many families started to breed rabbits as a source of protein for family food.

D. Read the passage again and then answer the questions :-
1- Describe Amna's family.
2- How did Amna get money to support her family at first?
3- How did the social worker help?
4- What do these words mean?

widow (para. 1), social worker (para. 2), flourished (para. 4), convince (para. 3), marketing (para. 3), household (para. 1).

NOTE : Read around the word to see if you can work out, or guess what the meaning is e.g. "expenses" in para. 1. Think about it: "She could hardly afford to pay for household expenses." Do you think "expenses" is to do with work or money? How do you know? What do you think "expenses" means?

E. Discussion Questions
1. Describe a family income generating activity you know of. How successful is it?
2. How are these income generating activities useful to a) the family, b) the community c) the nation.
3. Discuss an income generating project your school might do.

Letter to the Editor

[Image of an envelope with a key, addressed to "To: Aunt Layla,"]

Dear Editor,

I disagree with your article of March 18th, saying that the Sudanese do nothing to help themselves.

Self-help efforts and community participation in the welfare of the people are deeply rooted in our indigenous social practices and religious teaching. You can find it in various forms of aid and social support systems.

The communal work system called 'Nafeer" is an indigenous service exchange system where people pool their efforts to help a person to cultivate land, harvest crops or build a house. It is also used by communities to build schools, mosques or health centres to be used by all.

Recently, the Nafeer has been used by the government to encourage people to participate in development work. These days it is normal to hear of 'State Nafeers' in the form of large committees to carry out big development projects like agricultural and the building of roads, hospitals and dams.

The government delegates powers and responsibilities to these committees which enable them to use all sorts of means to raise funds and to encourage the people to participate in different ways. There are many successful efforts which can be witnessed. The 'Challenge Road' connecting Khartoum with the Northern State is a living example of this. In addition, there are countless examples of irrigation systems, big hospitals, schools and government offices built by communities.

I hope you will take note of this information.

Yours Sincerely
Ali Ahmed Sulieman
from Kosti

Section 3 Exploring Language

[Image of a cartoon face with letters.]

A. Working with Words

1. Forming adjectives
Form suitable adjectives to complete the sentences below. The first one is done for you.

[Box with verbs: move, renew, value, talk, compare, believe, attract]

1. I can renew that. It's renewable.
2. It's nearly as good as the last one. (It's ___________.)
3. It's funny when you think about it. (It's ____________.)
4. The other blackboard is better because you can move. (It's _____________.)
5. I like that. (It's _____________.)
6. I can't waste time. (It's _______________.)
7. I can't believe this. (It's un_______________.)
8. He talks a lot. (He's _________________.)

Compound Words
Look

Look at these two boxes and say what you see there. Tell your neighbour.
Now, look at these two kinds of word:
Compound words and Primary Words
One title belongs at the top of one box and the other at the top of the other. Which goes where, do you think? What does primary mean? What does compound mean here?

8

[Page 14]

Now Practise
[Image of a hand writing with a quill.]

Form as many compound words as possible from the following.
ache | foot | man | office | tap
ash | head | maid, | tooth | steps
ball | tray | master | table | fire
door | fly | milk | tea | school
gentle | house | post | water | out

How many of these can you use in one paragraph?

Example:
"Ali loved football, but he couldn't play today because he had a headache and toothache. His headmaster was a gentleman ...... etc

B. Spelling : Doubled Letters With Verbs

If the verb ends in one consonant and there is one vowel before it, then we double the consonant if the end of the word is stressed as in

run running
dig digging digger
admit admitting admitted

Now add -ing or -ed or both wherever appropriate and make the necessary spelling changes in your exercise book. Be careful: some words do not have doubled letters:

write | read | eat | ship
rob | shut | help | wash
step | set | fix | drop
plan | announce | forbid | quarrel

9

[Page 15]

B. Grammar Corner

Comparison of Adjectives:

Read the text and write down all the adjectives. Why do some of these adjectives end in -er / -est or have 'more'/'most' in front of them?

Ustaza Asha : As you know this week we are having the school environmental health competition. By the end of the week the cleanest and the most attractive class in the school will win the prize.
Zeinab : This is not fair. The older students will know better how to clean. It's more difficult for the younger ones to do the same.
Ustaza Asha : This is true. We will think of a fairer way of judging this.
Susan : I have a suggestion please: let the oldest and the youngest work together.
Ustaza Asha : Oh, this is one way of doing it. However, you should all try to do the best you can. The harder you work, the better chance you will have. Remember that the most important thing is to make our school the cleanest, the neatest and the most beautiful in the area.

Formation and use of Adjectives:

Read the whole of the passage below, then see if you can fill in the gaps. All the words (and parts of words) that you need are there somewhere.
The ___________ adjective is used when we compare 2 things.
The __________ adjective is used when we compare more than 2 things.
The comparative adjective is formed by adding __________ to the adjective as in "shorter" and "cleaner".
The superlative 'adjective' is formed by adding __________ to the adjective as in "biggest" and "smallest". When an adjective has two syllables or more, we usually use __________ for comparative adjectives and most for __________ ones.
Notice: a. Comparative construction can be used with 'than' e.g.
You are older than I am.
He is smaller than she is.

10

[Page 16]

b. You can have two comparative forms,
e.g. The more he eats, the fatter he gets.
The faster you run, the earlier you arrive.

Now Practise

a. Amna does not like her appearance, her home life or her school. She always compares herself to her young sister Salma.
Write what she says about herself:
e.g. My nose is big. My nose is bigger than Salma's.
1. My eyes are small.
2. My hair is thin.
3. I am not good at school.
4. My mother is not kind to me.

b. Insert the comparative or the superlative form of the adjective (as appropriate) :
1. I'd prefer to live in a (big) house.
2. Which of these bottles of milk is the (fresh)?
3. Who is the (fast) swimmer here?
4. You have to be (careful) with your money.
5. That's the (funny) joke I've heard for a long time.
6. It's (difficult) to swim than it looks.
7. She's the (tall) one in the class.
8. He's (good) at maths than I am.
9. I'm trying to eat (little) fruits.
10. She's (old) than I am.

Who might say these things? When? Why?

C. Time for Tenses:
[Image of a clock with Past, Present, Future.]
The timeless Present Present Simple:
Read the following passage and notice the use of the present tense.
When do we add the 's'?

11

[Page 17]

Litter is rubbish thrown on the ground or in the street. Where many people live together, litter is a problem. People don't always put the rubbish in the litter bin. They find it easier to drop a paper than to find a dustbin for it. But litter is ugly. It makes the city look dirty and it spoils the view.

The wind blows papers far away. Often they are difficult to catch. When they blow against a fence they stay there. The fence becomes a wall of rubbish.

Litter is a health problem too. Food and rubbish bring animals, which sometimes carry diseases.

From this we can see that :
- The present simple is not only used to describe present time but also it describes activities and states which are generally and universally true.
- The present simple is the tense for description, definition and statements of general timeless truth.
- Sometimes it is called the present habitual. It is used for repeated habitual activities.
- Adverbs of frequency e.g. usually, always, often .. etc are common time-markers in the present tense.
e.g. He usually wakes up at 5 o'clock.
They often visit us on Friday.

Remember :
The timeless Present Present Simple is formed like this:
- Verb to be:
I am
you are
He/She/It is
- Other verbs :-
Verb (infinitive) (+ s in third person singular form).
e.g. I eat
He teaches
She teaches

12

[Page 18]

- Auxiliary verbs :-
Do, does: for questions and negatives.
e.g Do you teach? No, I don't teach.
Does she teach? No, she doesn't teach.

Now practise :-
[Image of a hand writing with a quill.]

(1) Do this in pairs:
(x) First student: Change each sentence into a question.
(y) Second student: Answer each question with a short answer.

Examples:
Litter is a problem in our cities.
(x) Is litter a problem in our city?
(y) Yes, it is.

1- Throwing litter in the street is against the law.
2- Litter is ugly.
3- The wind blows papers far away.
4- Animals sometimes carry diseases.
5- Food and rubbish bring animals.

(2) Make complete sentence definitions using the present tense by matching the words from the left with phrases on the right:

1- litter | a. rubbish thrown on the ground or in the street.
2- fence | b. a special container for rubbish.
3- jail | c. everything that a person can see
4- litter bin | d. a wall that separates two places
5- view | e. sickness
6- disease | f. to arrange or to stop
7- control | g. a place where people stay as punishment.

13

[Page 19]

(3) Susan talks about her holidays in the south :-

Read and complete the passage, using the correct form of the present simple tense verbs given in brackets:

I ________ (go) to the south every year for my holiday. It always ________ (rain) a lot. People _________ (say) it ________ (be) the wettest place in the Sudan, but I _________ (not let) that worry me. In fact, my friends and I _________ (not miss) the sun at all, John _________ (say) he __________ (not go) on holiday for the sun, he _________ (go) for the scenery and the walking. What ________ (you expect) from a holiday? People __________ (have) different ideas about relaxation, I suppose.

(4) Ohaj hasn't met his friend Adam for ages. Suddenly Adam appears in Aroma, and Ohaj asks him questions. The following are the answers. What are Ohaj's questions?
1- I come from Aroma.
2- Yes, I quite like it here.
3- No, the climate doesn't suit me.
4- No, my parents don't write to me that often.
5- Yes, my job pays reasonably well.

Dear Aunt Layla...

I am seventeen and in my second year of secondary school. My problem is that my parents prefer my brother to me. My mother makes me wash the dishes and clean the house while my brother is doing his homework and revising for his exams. My father always gets him what he wants and only tells me to wait till later. They always encourage him to do better but never say anything to me. Please tell me what to do, I feel terrible.

Neglected, Kosti.

[Image of an envelope addressed to Aunt Layla.]

Dear Neglected,

I am sure you're imagining things. Parents do love and treat their children equally. Your mother is probably just trying to give you some training in housework and your father is simply unable to get you what you've asked for. Your brother is probably one of those people who constantly needs encouragement, while you are not. Why don't you talk to your parents about your feelings and see what they say to you?

Aunt Layla.

If you have a problem write to Aunt Layla c/o Spine Challenge.

(1) Do you agree with "Aunt Layla". How would you have answered this letter?
(2) On a piece of paper, write a short problem letter. Fold it and give it to your teacher. Your teacher will give it to another person to answer. In this way everybody writes a letter and everybody prefers to be Aunt Layla.

CHAPTER TWO : Rural and Urban Life

Village life is different from Urban life. The title of this passage is "The life of a mechanic". What are we going to learn when we read it, do you think? Tell the class so that the teacher writes a list on the board.

Section 1: Reading 1:

Is Umbada a town or a village?

The life of a Mechanic

The geography society of Ahlia Secondary School had arranged for field trips to several places inside the country. During their first visit to the Omdurman industrial area, they met an old colleague of theirs called Mubarak Hassan. He lives in Umbada, a new growing town west of the city of Omdurman, and now the capital of Umbada province. The town has a mixed community and does not belong to one tribe. In Umbada, we find people from different parts of the Sudan as well as foreigners.

After he obtained his school certificate from Omdurman Ahlia Secondary School, Mubarak decided to find a job as a mechanic in order to support his younger brothers and sisters. After only two years, Mubarak distinguished himself in his work and he became a well known mechanic in Omdurman industrial area. His employer was happy with him and he promoted him to the position of supervisor of the garage.

One day, Mubarak took the students to his place of work which is near Suk el Shaabi in Omdurman. While they were walking through the industrial area to his garage, they saw many light industry factories, each of them specialized in the manufacture of different materials. They saw logs of wood being turned into finished furniture such as chairs, tables and cupboards. They also saw blacksmiths shops, leather-works, an ironmongery and welding workshop. They arrived at the workshop where Mubarak works

21

[Page 27]

and they were served tea. Mubarak was explaining to them the functions of their multi-purpose workshop but they could not hear him very well as there was too much noise coming from all over the place. There was also a strong smell of smoke and an unpleasant smell of diesel fumes produced by the machines.

What things are important for the factory?

Mubarak told them that their factory was progressing successfully for three important reasons. First, it is situated near a big market which makes it easy for them to buy the necessary materials and to sell their finished products to the customers.

Second, there is a constant power supply as their garage falls within an area where electricity is constantly available. Third both manual and skilled labourers are found in great numbers in Umbada and its outskirts.

[Image of a mechanic working on a car in a busy market street.]

Does Mubarak have leisure time?

Mubarak closes the workshop every day at 4 p.m. except Fridays, when they close at 12 noon. He and his friend Fadlalla, who comes from Western Sudan, watch football every evening. They are keen supporters of Morada. They also go regularly to Umbada Folk Theatre, especially at weekends and they get good entertainment there. Mubarak's favourite hobbies include listening to music and reading.

22

[Page 28]

(B) Now answer the following questions:
1. Where does Mubarak Hassan live, and where does he work?
2. After how long was Mubarak promoted?
3. Which paragraph tells us how busy the industrial area is?
4. Why was it not possible to hear Mubarak when he was talking to the students in the workshop?
5. Why is the workshop doing so well?
6. Where does Mubarak go in his free time?

23

[Page 29]

Life in a Baggara village

When the students met Fadlalla in Umbada, he invited them to visit his village called Um Marfaheen in Southern Kordofan state. It took them three days to get there and the journey was by lorry and on donkeys. Fadlalla comes from one of the Baggara tribes. The people in his village and other surrounding villages live in their tribal groups. They live in areas known as Dar which are administered by their tribal Sheikhs or Omdas. The Dar is not a permanent village because the Baggara are nomads. The people of Um Marfaheen keep a lot of cattle.

The Baggara live in shelters made of canvas tents which are comfortable to live in and easy to dismantle. There was a great deal of activity in Mubarak's village. In the morning, the visitor saw young boys cleaning the stables. Women and girls were working like busy bees, pounding dura for making asida. The cows were milked at eight o'clock and by nine o'clock in the morning all the cattle were let out for grazing, and they were brought back in the evening.

Why don't the Baggara settle in one Dar?

Fadlalla asked the students whether they knew their geography very well! The Baggara, he said, move according to the weather conditions. In April or May, when the rains begin to fall, they leave Bahr El Arab for Um Marfaheen to avoid cattle disease carried by insects. They settle in the Dar for some time to grow dura and other crops for food. As the rains increase, they move further northwards and settle on higher ground called goz. At the end of the rainy season, they return to Um Marfaheen to harvest their crops. After that they move again southwards to Bahr El Arab in search of grazing areas and water. This same cycle is repeated each year.

1. What means of transport did they use to go to Um Marfaheen?
2. Who rules a Dar in the Baggara area?
3. What were the young boys and girls doing in the morning?
4. Where were the cattle taken after 9 a.m?
5. When do the Baggara leave Bahr El Arab and why do they do so?
6. Look at your list of differences again. Now you have read the description of the way the Baggara live, can you explain why the villages are different from the town?

What are the uses of cattle for the Baggara?

Cattle in the Life of a Baggara

It is difficult to imagine a Baggara living without cattle. Cattle are a source of wealth, of food and of pride. Bulls can be sold for cash. Women make butter from milk for local consumption or for sale in the markets.

25

[Page 31]

Traditionally, cattle are used as a dowry and for the payment of blood money or 'diha'. When they are on the move, the Baggara use bulls for carrying women, children and household furniture.

[Image of Baggara people travelling, with goods and people carried by oxen.]

What do the Baggara do during their leisure time?

The men sometimes go hunting in the surrounding forest. The village Sheikhs often sit under a big tree to settle disputes according to their tribal law. Young people enjoy themselves playing and singing in the evenings after the cattle are herded into the stables. When the evening meal is over, the family members sit around a fire. The old people tell folk stories to the children before they fall asleep.

(E) Now read the passage again carefully, and answer the questions
1. How do the Baggara get money from their cattle?
2. What is the dowry used for?
3. How do the Baggara youth spend their evenings?
4. Why do the Sheikhs sit under a big tree?

2. Who settles disputes in your area?
3. Have you ever listened to folk stories? Who tells them and where?
4. Have you ever ridden a bull, made butter or loaded things on a bull?

26

[Page 32]

(G) Read this folk story quickly and answer the question below :

Why did the man decide to visit the town?

A Folk Story

There was once a man who lived in a small village in the country. Since his youth, he had never visited any of the urban centres in the area because he thought he needed nothing from the towns.

One day, he told his wife that he had decided to visit a friend of his who lived in the town. He climbed on his donkey and left the village for the town. It was quite a long ride for him. At midday, he arrived at the main road. He followed it and he met many people who were carrying loads of goods. He also met several vehicles carrying passengers and heavy loads. He was surprised because none of those he met ever stopped to greet or talk to him as they do in the village. The man began to ask himself why people were leaving the town in such a hurry, and whether it was safe to proceed. He felt that it was wiser to return to the village at once.

What did he tell his wife?

When he arrived home, his wife did not believe her eyes. She immediately asked him if he had really reached the town. He replied saying: "Have I not always told you that I am the most unlucky person in this village, and you are never convinced? You see! Now, when I wanted to visit the town for the first time, I found it was being evacuated!"

(H) Now answer the following questions:
1. What means of transport did the man use to go to the town?
2. Where were the people and the vehicles he found on the main road going?
3. Why was the man surprised?
4. What was the man afraid of?
5. Why did the man consider himself to be a very unlucky person?

27

[Page 33]

(I) Discussion questions:
1. Do you think there was any real danger in the town?
2. Do you know of any person in your home who does not like living: (a) in the town? (b) in the village?
3. Where do people know each other better; in the town or in the village? Why?

CHAPTER THREE : Women Issues and concerns

These days a lot of attention is drawn to women's issues and concerns. Their needs, abilities, knowledge and contributions to development are becoming the focus of many studies.

Section 1 : Reading 1
(A) Read the passage carefully then answer the following questions:-

What is the main idea of the text?

Women and Food Technology
[Image of a woman cooking over a fire.]

All over the world, providing food is regarded as a women's job. Women's knowledge of food production and food processing and preparation enables them to feed their families even in difficult climatic and environmental conditions. Yet all too often in the past their skills have been ignored.

Now, however, in many African countries, people are beginning to realize that women's techniques of food production can be both simpler and safer to use than those imported from elsewhere.

There is a growing understanding of women's technical knowledge. A lot of research has been done which shows that they possess highly scientific knowledge in some areas.

Many people are now convinced that this knowledge should form the basis of any new technological development. Development organizations are now working with women to help them use their own technical skills to improve food production. This shows that appropriate technical assistance does not always mean bringing a new machine. It could simply mean supporting local techniques or building on local knowledge.

We have a good example of this here in the Sudan. One case study, for example, showed that some Sudanese women possess a wealth of scientific

37

[Page 43]

knowledge of food fermentation.

Fermentation is a valuable method of food preservation. It also improves the digestion of food. Sudanese women can make about sixty different types of fermented food products, prepared from many types of grains. Of these, about thirty are made from sorghum or millet.

How many of these fermented sorghum foods can you name?
Read on to see if any of yours are mentioned below.

Among the most common sorghum foods in the Sudan are a fermented thick porridge called 'aseeda', fermented bread called 'kisra' and a fermented drink called 'abreh'. These have high nutritional value. Abreh, for example is both, a nutritious drink and good for satisfying thirst in the hot climate of the Sudan. It is widely believed in the Sudan that a drink of abreh is better for a thirsty person than plain water. In addition to being nutritious, the acidity of fermented sorghum decreases the risks of polluted water. Abreh flakes are light in weight and can easily be carried by travellers. Abreh can also be stored for a long time.

Women's knowledge of food fermentation has also played an important role in coping with periods of famine, when previous supplies of food need to be carefully preserved.

(B) Now read the text again carefully and then answer the following questions:
1/ Is producing food considered a man's or a women's job?
2/ What have women learnt from producing food?
3/ Give examples of the local technical knowledge women have?
4/ What are women responsible for?
5/ What can men learn from women?
6/ Appropriate assistance or technology does not mean 'a new machine'. what does it really mean?
7/ It is said that Sudanese women have great knowledge about food, Explain.

(D) Discussion questions:
1/ What do women in your local community produce?
2/ Do they also depend on fermentation? If so, how?
3/ How can your local community make maximum use of women's knowledge about food?

38

[Page 44]

Section 2 : Reading II

A. A Questionnaire
[Image of a girl reading.]
"A woman's place is in the home"
Do you agree or disagree?

Salma did a survey of people's opinions about women going out to work. She wrote the following report for the principal of Al Nahda Girls Secondary School.

Read Salma's report quickly then answer the questions.
How many sections are there in Salma's report?

Report
Survey of People's Opinion Concerning Women's Work

1. Aims
To discover people's opinions on the following issues:-
a/ Whether women should go out to work or not.
b/ What sort of jobs/professions are suitable for them.

2. Method
A questionnaire was used. It consisted of the following questions:
(1) Do you believe that women should do paid work?
[ ] Yes [ ] No
(2) What sort of job do you think is suitable for women? choose one.
a. [ ] A part-time job near the home?

c. [ ] A home job?
d. [ ] Any other (please specify ......)
(3) What sort of professions do you think?
a. [ ] teaching
b. [ ] nursing
c. [ ] engineering
d. [ ] all professions

39

[Page 45]

3. Statistical results
The questionnaires were distributed to 250 students, currently registered at the school. 200 completed questionnaires were returned. The replies were as follows:-

Question 1: Should women work?
[Pie chart showing Yes 50%, No 50%]

Question 2: What sort of jobs are suitable for women?
[Pie chart showing a - 55%, b - 22%, c - 15%, d - 8%]

Question 3: What sort of professions should women have?
[Pie chart showing a - 50%, b - 22%, c - 18%, d - 10%]

4. Conclusion
The students were equally divided on the question of women's work.
Of those who thought there are special types of jobs which suit women, the majority (55%) considered a part-time job near the home was best. On the question of suitable professions for women, 50% chose teaching and only 10% thought that all professions were suitable for women.

B. Read the text again and answer these questions:-
1/ Why did Salma write the survey?
2/ What method did she use?
3/ How many people were in favour of paid work for women? and how many were against it?
4. What about you?

C. (1) Study these statistics.
[Pie chart showing 50% fifty percent, 35% thirty five percent, 15% fifteen percent]

40

[Page 46]

[Bar chart showing percentages:]
65% xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx the majority
35% xxxxxxxxx the minority
85% xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx large majority
15% xxx a small minority

[Pie chart showing 50% and 50% labeled "Women's work survey". Text next to it reads: "The opinions are equally divided. 50% are in favour of women's work. 50% are against women's work."]

(2) Transferring statistical tables to sentences.
In your exercise book, write five sentences about the following statistics. Use words like "thought / considered / chose" etc.

Survey of opinions concerning Films : Statistics
Q.1 Which films are the most enjoyable?
| Crime thrillers 52% | Cowboy films 18% | Spy films 15% | Comedies 10% | Cartoons 5% |

Example :-
1) 52% thought crime thrillers were the most enjoyable.
2) ...................
3) ...................
4) ...................

(3) Read again the method section in A. Do one of these surveys. Make three questions for a questionnaire :-
1- Survey of opinions concerning sources of energy.
2- Survey of opinions concerning shopping.
3- Survey of opinions concerning co-education.

41

[Page 47]

(4) Compare your questions with your neighbour.

D. Read the following text quickly, then answer the question.

Is it still a man's world?

Women on the Move
[Image of a woman with a baby on her back, using a weighing scale.]

There are areas of employment that tend to be dominated by either males or females. It has been observed that highly educated men are less likely to choose a traditionally female job, while educated females are broadening their choices quite well. Female engineers and agriculturists are no longer strange to see. Forty two year old Fatima Salih qualified as a surveyor in 1980. At that time she was the only female surveying engineer working for the government. Now there are more than ten working for the department of Surveying at the Federal level alone. "I don't think that school girls are given enough encouragement to go into this profession", says Fatima, "It is time to break through this barrier".
Fatima now works for 'Mecca Surveyors', one of the top five surveying companies in the country. Mecca Surveyors gives equal job opportunities for both sexes. This policy helps to increase the number of women in this line of work.

E. A reporter held an interview with Fatima for a radio programme. Read the passage and supply Fatima's answers to his questions in your notebook.
Reporter's questions
1) When did you qualify as an engineer?
2) Are there many women in this profession?
3) Have you ever felt that you chose the wrong profession?
4) Do you consider yourself lucky?
5) How do the men feel about you?

F. Discussion Questions
1/ What do you think of Fatima?
2/ Are you in favour of women working: why? / why not?

42

[Page 48]

Section 3 : Exploring Language

(A) Working with words
(a) Nouns ending in ............ tion
........... sion
........... ssion
Many nouns can be formed by adding the suffixes .......... tion, .......... sion, ...... ssion, to the verbs.
e.g form -> formation
invite -> invitation
revise -> revision
televise -> television
permit -> permission
submit -> submission

N.B. You will notice there is sometimes a change in spelling. One of the most common is to change the final (e) to (a)
e.g organise -> organisation

Now Practise
1. Study these verbs, Form nouns from them using the suffixes above.
occupy | associate | admire | admit
compose | abbreviate | provide
adopt | confuse

2. Now form verbs out of these nouns:
classification | graduation | promotion
accommodation | definition | instruction

(b) Argumentative phrases
In taking part in a discussion, a number of phrases are useful to express your own opinion / point of view.
Note the following :-
- I think ..............
- I suggest ..............

43

[Page 49]

- In my opinion .....................
- In my view .......................
- In my point of view ..............
- As I see it ......................
- As far as I am concerned ........

Now practise
Ali and Mona were arguing about Ali's going away to work abroad. Fill in the spaces below with argumentative phrases to find out Mona's opinion.
'I ............ it is not the right thing to do now.
May I ............ that you should delay it.
............... I am not going to support you in that.'

(B) Grammar Corner
1. Can/could, Selwa and Rasha are boasting about their abilities
Selwa : I can read.
I can sing.
I can dance.
I can do a thousand other things.
Rasha : When I was six years old
I could swim.
I could cook.
I could ride a bicycle.
I could play the guitar.
I could do what my mother could do when she was fifteen.

Notice that :-
a/ can implies the ability to do something in the present and future time.
can may be used instead of a future tense in conditional and time clauses, e.g :-
If/when the children are bored, you can read to them.
can is also used to give permission, e.g You can pay workers overtime.

44

[Page 50]

b/ could is used as the past tense form of can when we refer to things that we had the ability to do in the past. e.g
I could ride a bicycle when I was six years old.
Therefore, could is used in narrative to describe ability or knowledge in the past.

Now practise
Fatima is telling us about herself. Insert can, can't, could or couldn't into these sentences to find out about her.
1. I _________ usually cook quite well, but last night I __________ get it right.
2. I __________ speak French without any problems when I was small, but I __________ speak very much now.
3. I __________ see very well, so I need the light on.
4. I __________ compose music when I was nine. Do you believe me?!

2. May/might
1- Motorbikes may seem a sign of progress compared to bicycles. However, the motor car run on electricity might be a sign of better progress.
2- The results of space research may be useful to us in the future. However, it might be stopped because of its high cost.

May and might express possibility in the present and future. We use (might) when we do not think that something is very probable.

The present perfect
Mrs. Clark and her daughter Susan have been out shopping, and they've just returned home.
Mrs. Clark has just opened a letter and she's received bad news. She has lost her job. She's worked as a secretary for a rich engineer since 1976. The engineer has lived in this area for 35 years. Now he has decided to stop working and leave. He's asked Mrs. Clark to find another job.

Now Note
1/ The present perfect is formed by have/has + participle
e.g have been; has received
2/ It is used with 'just' to describe a recently complete action
e.g Mrs. Clark has just opened .......
3/ It is used with 'since' and 'for' to describe an action which began in the past and is still continuing.
e.g ...... has worked as a secretary since 1976
..... has lived in the area for 35 years.
4) It can also be used to describe an action in the past when no time or date is stated. e.g
- I've been to America.
- He's seen this film before.
5) It is also used with time expressions like never/always/often/seldom to mean up to now. e.g.:-

(Expressing different points of view)

(A) Read this.
Read this heated discussion between Tarig and Sara.
Tarig : Oh no, they are opening two more separate universities for women. It makes me sick to think of all that money being thrown on having separate buildings, separate staff, separate libraries etc etc.... when millions of people mainly women, are completely illiterate!!!
Sara : I don't think the money is being thrown away, you can't ignore the fact that more women are wanting to go into university than before. In addition, having separate universities enables women to have a different curriculum dealing with their specific issues and concerns. Here they will be able to solve many of their problems.

What are Tarig's points against and Sara's points for separate universities?

(B) Step by Step
Amal thinks that both the views expressed by Tarig and Sara are right in a way. Read what Amal says below and pick out her points for and her points against. Add more points for and against of your own.
Amal: I think you're both right in a way, though personally I'm more

47

[Page 53]

on Sara's side. University education for women deserves expansion. It does encourage women to look into their own issues and concerns. But of course if you think that educating the illiterate is the most urgent problem we need to solve, any money that does not go directly for that does seem wasted.

(C) Over to you
(1) Write a composition of 150 words on co-education

My love is like a red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June
My love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune.
So fair are you my bonnie lass*
So deep in love am I,
That I will love you still, my dear
Till all the seas run dry,
Till all the seas run dry, my dear
And the rocks melt with the sun
And I will love you still, my dear
While a thousand ages run.

Words of Wisdom:
The secret of making something work in your lives is
. First of all
The deep desire to make it work;
Then the faith and belief
That it can work;
Then to hold that clear definite vision in your consciousness
And see it working out
Step by step
Without one thought
Or doubt or disbelief

Aunt Layla,
My friend treats me badly and has turned all my other friends against me. Before she came to my school I was very popular and never let anyone push me around. But she's changed me. We were best friends for two years and then we had a row and she is making my life very difficult and I cry all the time. I feel sad because I really want to be best friends again, but she doesn't.
Lonely, Khartoum

Dear Lonely,
Everyone argues with their best friends from time to time, but your friend seems to have gone too far with her anger. Whatever you had a row about doesn't give her the excuse to tell lies about you. She obviously knows she is upsetting you and now she seems to be enjoying her power over you. This is not the way for a so-called friend to behave. You ask yourself why you want to hold on to her. Try to make other friends and you'll find it a lot easier.

CHAPTER FOUR : Customs and Habits

Human beings are creatures of habit: they like and need to do certain things in the same way over a period of time. In communities they develop certain values and traditions.

Section 1: Reading 1
A. Examine the following picture carefully and answer the questions below it.

[Image of a village with round huts, set against a rocky, mountainous backdrop.]

2. How can you tell?
3. What comments can you make about this picture?
4. Do you think there is air and noise pollution in this area?
5. Would you like to live there? Why? / Why not?

B. Read the passage quickly and answer this question.
What types of collective work are mentioned in the following passage?

Collective Work in the Nuba Mountains

The Sudanese are a hard working people. It is interesting to know that throughout their long history, the Sudanese have developed various common customs and habits that promote work. One of these habits is known all over the Sudan as collective work, or 'nafeer'. People who live in towns use this method to build schools, health centres or clean their streets collectively on a self-help basis. Those who live in rural areas also build

53

[Page 59]

their houses and cultivate their farms collectively.

If you pay a visit to the Nuba Mountains for example, you will find people building houses, farming, harvesting and threshing the grain collectively. Every able person, man or woman, has to participate equally in any collective work.

There are three types of collective work in the Nuba Mountains. The first method is based on work teams formed by people from one village who agree to work collectively whenever any of its members has some work that requires many hands. The number of people in one work team should not exceed ten. The second type of collective work is done through personal invitation. This means that if a person wants something to be done for him by many people, he can invite as many people as possible to come to his assistance on the day he has fixed. The third method of collective work is a voluntary one. For example a son-in-law can decide to go with friends to his father-in-law's house to do a specific job which the in-laws cannot do by themselves.

Who provides food for the work team?

Before the fixed date for the collective work arrives, the host must prepare a sufficient amount of food for the workers. There is always a sheep or a goat which must be slaughtered for this occasion. There are other types of food which are also provided for the guests. Everyone must bring with him or her the necessary tools e.g a hoe if it is cultivation they are coming for. Usually, some of the guests carry with them some food which they contribute for the occasion. These include cooked chicken, some porridge, tea and coffee.

There are only two meals served to the work team: breakfast and dinner. In addition, tea, coffee and porridge are served at intervals. No one sits down to rest until the end of the working day at 5 p.m. Special work songs are sung to encourage people to work hard.

What are the advantages of the work teams?

If you ask anyone from the Nuba Mountains, he or she will tell you there are several advantages of team work. Ustaz Musa Kodi from Heiban had this to say about this important custom.
"Collective work strengthens the co-operation between the people of a particular area. It makes everyone feel concerned with the welfare of each individual in the society, whether that person is strong or weak. Team work also cultivates in the people a sense of competition among the different villages. That's why we regard it as the most valuable custom in the Nuba Mountains."

Section 2 : Reading 1

A. Read the following passage quickly and answer this question.
Find from the passage two examples of hospitality.

Sudanese Hospitality

When guests or strangers come to our homes, we always welcome them in a friendly and generous manner. We also make it our duty to entertain them and to make them comfortable with whatever we have available. This practice is called hospitality.

[Image of a group of men sitting on a traditional bed (angareb) outside a hut, being served by another man.]

We Sudanese people are well known for our unique brand of hospitality both to Sudanese friends as well as to any people who come to the Sudan from other countries. Every Sudanese head of the family believes that it is his duty to maintain this valued tradition and to breed into his children a sense of hospitality. Those children will be the parents of the future who will influence the values and direction of our society.

Because this practice has dominated our lives and way of thinking for many centuries, it is common to find people travelling to distant places inside the Sudan without carrying any food with them. Yet, they are always sure of finding food and even a place to stay wherever they go.

Of course the ways of showing hospitality are different from one area to another. But in all areas the tradition of welcoming and looking after our guests is the same.

56

[Page 62]

B. Now read the passage again carefully and answer the following questions.
1. What do we do to visitors who come to our homes?
2. Why do Sudanese parents want their children to maintain their traditional ways of hospitality?
3. Are the ways of hospitality the same all over the Sudan?

C. Discussion Questions
Discuss the customs and manners of entertaining the following visitors in your area.
1. Relatives and friends
2. Foreign visitors
3. Strangers who are forced by circumstances to be your guests.

D. Read this dialogue quickly and answer this question.
Are any of the stories about foreigners?

Personal Experiences of Sudanese Hospitality

Ustaz Musa, the English Language teacher asked his students to explain some of their experiences of Sudanese hospitality.

Ustaz Musa: Can any of you tell the class a story about Sudanese hospitality?
Omer: Yes, Sir! I'd like to talk about our visit to Jebel Mara.
Ustaz Musa: O.K.
Omer: My brother Hashim and I visited Jebel Mara a year ago at the invitation of a friend. We were travelling on a lorry from El Fashir to Jebel Mara. Unfortunately, the lorry broke down at a small village a few miles away from our destination. The passengers were taken care of by the people of that village. Hashim and I were accommodated by an old couple. They offered us a chicken for our supper and gave us two beds to sleep on. The following morning, we were surprised to learn that the chicken we had eaten for supper was the only one left in the house. We also discovered that the family members had slept on the floor because their beds had been offered to us.
Ustaz Musa: Good. Let's hear another story - John!
John: Yes I have a similar story. We were travelling by lorry from Wau to Gogrial. When we arrived at Lukluk, we had a puncture near a Dinka cattle camp. The leader of that camp invited all of the passengers to his camp and gave us all the milk they had and left nothing for

57

[Page 63]

themselves. The tyre was repaired and we left.
Ustaz Musa: That was also great hospitality according to Dinka tradition.

E. Now read the dialogue again carefully, then answer the questions.
1. Why did Omer and Hashim go to Jebel Mara?
2. What happened to the lorry they were travelling on?
3. Who accommodated Omer and Hashim?
4. What was strange about the chicken which Omer and Hashim ate for supper?
5. Why did John and other passengers stop at Lukluk?

F. Discussion Questions
1. Who can tell the class about his/her own favourite experience of Sudanese hospitality?
2. Which people do you think are more hospitable: Urban people or rural people?
3. Do you think Sudanese hospitality is still an important custom in your home or is it declining? What do you think should be done in order to strengthen it?

Shop Assistant: Hello, can I help you?
Afaf: Yes, please. I'd like to buy a blouse, size ten.
Shop Assistant: Well, could you please tell me which colour you prefer?
Afaf: Here's a beautiful red blouse, how do you like it?

Afaf: Here it is. Would you like to try it?
Shop Assistant: No, thanks.

b. Talk about the things you like/prefer/dislike.
Talk about animals; food; entertainment; sports.

59

[Page 65]

2. Like and Prefer with verbs.
a. Now read this conversation.
Musa: Would you like to go to the swimming pool with me?
Adam: No, thanks. I don't like swimming. I dislike it. But I like playing tennis.
Musa: Would you like to go to the theatre with me in the evening?
Adam: Yes, I like going to the theatre in the evening.

b. For each of the choices below, say which one you prefer and why. Read the example then do the others
Example:
1. listening to the radio/watching TV.
I prefer listening to the radio to watching TV because when you listen to the radio, you can do something else at the same time.
2. eat in a restaurant / eat at home.
3. learn English / learn mathematics.
4. drive a car / ride a motor cycle.
5. do farming / do office work.
6. travel by plane / travel by bus.

3. Prefixes re - fore - over -
We can make new words by adding letters to the beginning of words.
Example: add re - (again); fore - (front) and over - (more, too much) to form new words.
1. he built the house - re- He rebuilt the house.
2. She touched her head - fore- She touched her forehead.
3. The child has eaten - over- The child has overeaten.

Now make words by adding the following prefixes : re - fore - over -
The words are :-
come __________ | father _________
turn __________ | dress _________
filter __________ | settle _________
collect __________ | confident _________
gain __________ | knowledge ________
cast __________ | write __________

Now try to write 6 true statements using these words and 6 questions. Use each word once only.

CHAPTER FIVE : HEALTH AWARENESS

In the past, illness was a great mystery. In many ways it still is, but in the 20th century people have made many important discoveries about the causes of illness and therefore how to prevent it.

Section 1 : Reading 1
A: Read the passage quickly and answer the questions.

Can we see germs?

The Fight against Germs

Scientists have discovered that a lot of illnesses and deaths are caused by GERMS. They enter a person's body through food and water, in the air we breath or through contact with an infected person. Thankfully, we can fight germs both inside and outside our bodies.

Germs can only be seen through a microscope. When germs enter our blood stream, our body produces special white blood cells which attack and try to destroy the germs. Often, in order to get well, we simply need to help our bodies to fight germs. We can do this by resting, drinking plenty of juice and eating nutritious food.

[Image of white blood cells as people fighting off germs.]
[Image of a microscope.]

Fighting against germs takes a lot of energy. This is why we often feel tired when we are sick. We should, of course, always ask a doctor for help and advice when we are ill. Doctors too can help us to beat the germs!

We can also fight against germs outside the body, by stopping the spread of germs. We must do things which will either destroy germs or keep them away from us.

[Page 75]

Why is using soap important?

Many illnesses, especially diarrhoea are caused by the germs found in human faeces. People can swallow these germs if they get into water, onto food or onto utensils and surfaces used for preparing food. To prevent this from happening we must use latrines. If it is not possible to use a latrine, adults and children should use places well away from houses, paths, water supplies and anywhere that children play.

Animal droppings, too, should be kept away from houses and water sources.

There are many other ways in which we can reduce illness. When we wash our hands with soap, we remove the germs from our hands. If there are no germs on our hands, the germs will not get onto our food or into our mouths when we eat. It is important to wash our hands after going to the toilet and before touching food.

People with no running water cannot fight germs. True or False?

Families who have a plentiful supply of running water and know how to use it, will have fewer illnesses. But families without running water in their homes can reduce illnesses by keeping wells and zeers covered.
If food - especially meat - is left uncovered, it quickly becomes covered in germs. These are often carried by flies. The behaviour of flies is disgusting. They regularly excrete and vomit any food they land on, stamping down mess with their feet.
The best way to keep food safe is to keep the flies off it. Then it must be carefully washed and thoroughly cooked.
In our climate, if no refrigerator is available, germs rapidly increase with the heat. We need to boil soups and stews to make them safe to eat.
Finally, illness can be prevented by burning or burying household rubbish. This is because germs can be spread by flies which like to breed in dirty places. So every family should have a special pit where left-over food can be buried every day.

[Page 76]

B. Read the passage again carefully, and answer these questions.
1. Complete this table by finding from the passage ways in which germs are spread and matching them with ways of preventing the spread of germs
(There may be MANY ways of preventing ONE problem)

| SPREAD OF GERMS THROUGH | PREVENTION |
|---|---|
| food | wash hands; cover food; boil food |
| | |

Match the words from the passage with those in the box below.
cups, plates, knives etc. - putting under the ground
toilet - touch - take away - kill - a lot of

1. Contact - para 2
2. destroy - para 5
3. utensils - para 6
4. latrine - para 6
5. remove - para 7
6. plentiful - para 8
7. burying - para 9

C. Discussion Questions.
1. Wells and zeers contain water. Make a list of other water containers. How can we make sure the water in these containers is kept clean?
2. In your opinion, what is the most important piece of information in the passage?
3. Make a) a poster and b) a short sketch to encourage people to stop the spread of germs. (Use your answers to question 2 to help you).

[Page 77]

Section 2: Reading II

A. Germs are only one example of things which make us unhealthy. There are more examples. Read each one carefully and match it to the cartoon picture.

a. [Image of an old man in a rocking chair, looking sad.]
ACCIDENTS. There are thousands of accidents every day at work, on the roads and at home. In fact, most accidents happen at home. Accidents can result in minor injuries, serious illness or death.

b. [Image of two people exercising.]
TOO LITTLE EXERCISE. Without exercise our bodies become slow and fat. We also become weak and less able to fight illness. Some people get enough exercise in their daily activities, but most people need to have special times for exercising.

c. [Image of a person lying on the floor, seemingly under the influence.]
DRUGS. Some drugs can make us well, but others can be harmful. These substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, glue, cocaine, heroin etc. can damage our minds as well as our bodies.

d. [Image of a person sick in bed with another person attending to them.]
STRESS. people worry about money, their family, their health, exams etc. When we worry too much or have many things to do, this is called STRESS. Stress can make us lose sleep, lose too much weight and cause heart problems.

e. [Image of an overweight person walking down stairs.]
DIET. Like drugs, the food we eat can keep us healthy or make us ill. Some people eat too much or too little. Others eat the wrong kind of food. When we have a BALANCED DIET, we eat just the right kind of food and the right amount.

72

[Page 78]

B. Now read again about each of the health problems above and decide if the following statements are true (T) or false (F). Correct the false statements.
1. If we exercise we will think and move faster.
2. Worry can prevent us from sleeping.
3. Drugs and food can help us and harm us.
4. Even a small amount of worry will damage our health.
5. Tobacco is a drug.
6. Accidents always result in death.
7. Doing too much work is not good for our heart.
8. Road accidents are the most common kind of accident.

C. Discussion Questions
1. Think about the health problems mentioned so far in this chapter (germs, drugs, stress, too little exercise, accidents, diet) and PUT THEM IN ORDER. Number one will be the MOST COMMON health problem in your area; number six will be the LEAST COMMON.
2. What ADVICE would you give to people with each of these problems.

D. Read the poem below and then put the pictures in the correct order, to show what the writer was like at first, next etc.
[Image of three faces showing increasing anger.]

73

[Page 79]

ANGER

I was angry and mad,
And it seemed that was hot water inside me,
And as I got madder and madder,
The water got hotter and hotter all the time,
I was in a rage,
Then I began to see colours,
Like black and red,
Then as I got madder and madder,
My eyes began to pop out of my head,
They were popping up and down,
It was horrible,
And it would not stop.
I was steaming with anger,
Nobody could stop me,
Then it was gone,
And I was all-right,
Horrible, black, madness

(Yvonne Lowe, aged 8)

E. Read the poem again carefully and answer the following questions.
1. Which colours has the poet used to describe her anger?
2. Why has she chosen those colours?
3. Which liquid has she chosen to describe her anger? Why?

F. Discussion Questions
1. What do you do when you get angry?
2. What kinds of things make you angry?
Write the three things that make you most angry.
3. Does stress cause anger or does anger cause stress?! Explain your answer.

Section Three : Exploring Language

A. Working With Words
Look at these words. Can you explain their meanings?
| government | cruelty | ability |
|---|---|---|
| improvement | safety | mobility |
| treatment | | reality |

- Can you make a sentence for each one?
- Now look at the words again. Can you see any similarities between any of them?
- How do they end?
- Are they nouns, verbs or adjectives?
- If you take the endings off, what are you left with: nouns, verbs, or adjectives?
- Can you think of any other examples where we can make a verb or adjective into a noun?

Now complete the passage below with appropriate nouns.
treat | improve | major | govern | responsible
Every week millions of children die in developing countries. The _________ of them die because they do not get proper __________. when they are ill. It is the __________ of the __________ to work for the __________ of children's health.

C. Plurals
Most nouns have an 's' at the end when they are plural. The sound at the end of these plurals is /s/ (cats) or /z/ (dogs).
1. Change these nouns into the plural and pronounce them correctly.
2. Try to MATCH the words e.g Toys and balls are things you play with. Ships and boats carry people across rivers.
1. bag | 2. hat | 3. toy | 4. boat | 5. ball

Section 4 : Writing:
Information Transfer.

A. Read this:
Mr. Ambo is going on holiday to Vandalon, and has written to a friend, Bimbo, asking for advice on hotels.
Read Bimbo's reply and use the information given to complete the table which follows.
I have stayed in three hotels in Vandalon this year. The North Beach hotel is nice but very expensive. The hotel has 140 rooms. The room which I had was comfortable and it had a telephone, a colour T.V and a separate bathroom. In the magnificent restaurant on the roof you can eat very delicious and tasty food. The hotel is not far from the city centre and it is facing the beach.
The Broadford hotel is a long way from the city centre. It costs less than half the price. It doesn't have a restaurant. My room was very small and it had a telephone but there was no T.V. Worst of all it had no separate bathroom. I don't think it is comfortable and so I don't recommend it. It has only 50 rooms.
However, I think the Castle View hotel is the most comfortable, although it costs a little more than Broadford Hotel. I stayed in a very

77

[Page 83]

pleasant room which had the same facilities as North Beach. The hotel had a nice restaurant in which delicious food is served. The hotel overlooks the castle and has 120 rooms.

| | Broadford hotel | North Beach hotel | Castle View hotel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Location | | | |
| No. of Rooms | | | |
| Cost/2 weeks | £ 200 | £ 120 | |
| Telephone | | | |
| T.V | | | ✓ |
| bathroom | X | | |

B. Step by Step
1/ Notice some of the words and phrases used to talk about the information:
- is/was, is not/was not
- has/had; does not have/ did not have
- costs; serves
- the same as / -er than / different from.
2/ Using the information in the table below:
a) Describe each hotel e.g the 'White Swan' has air-conditioning.
b) Compare the hotels e.g. The 'White Swan' costs the same as the "Red Lion"

| | White Swan Hotel | Red Lion Hotel |
|---|---|---|
| Location | in the town centre | 5 miles from town |
| cost/week | £ 100 | £ 100 |
| hotel bus | ✓ | x |
| food | quite good | excellent |
| games (chess etc,) | ✓ | x |
| bathroom (private) | x | ✓ |
| air-conditioning | ✓ | ✓ |

LEISURE
What is this life so full of care, (= worry)
We have no time to stand and stare?
No time to stand beneath the boughs (= branches)
And stare as long as sheep or cows.
No time to see in broad daylight,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.
A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

Dear Aunt Layla,
I am quite an intelligent pupil and my marks in class tests are good. I am often able to answer the teacher's questions when everyone else has great difficulty. I enjoy studying and love my teachers and my school.
When exam time comes, however, I do very badly. Last term my highest grade was a c+ and I failed two subjects. Weeks before the exams I find it impossible to sleep or to think about anything but exams, exams, exams. When I see the exam paper, my mind goes completely blank, my heart beats fast and I feel like running away.
Please help me as I sit the school certificate this year.
Anxious, Dongola

Dear Anxious,
You cannot run away from your exams, so you must overcome your fear of them. Study hard and do lots of exam practice up until the week before the exams, (your teachers will help you with this). Then, the week before the exams do lots of things which will take your mind off the problem. Get plenty of sleep, take extra exercise, visit lots of friends, (but not school friends!), try a new hobby, help someone in need.
When exam time comes, you will be relaxed and your mind will be fresh and you will be able to answer the questions confidently.
Good luck!
Aunt Layla.

- A woman carrying a container on her head: "The source of life"
- A man farming under clouds: "liquid gold!"

83

[Page 89]

B. Read the following text about water quickly and answer the questions:
How many uses of water has the writer mentioned?

Water : More Precious Than Gold

Water is one of the most abundant substances on earth. Two thirds (2/3) of the surface of the earth is covered with water. It is found in nature in the forms of ice, snow, liquid or steam.
Water is also one of the most essential substances for living. All humans, animals and plants need water to survive. Water is also used in manufacturing and industry. It is used to cool big engines in factories, to produce and distribute heat and to generate electrical power; to transport goods and dispose of waste.

Where do we get water from?

[Image of people collecting water in a desert setting and another image of an animal drinking trough.]

We get water from many sources. We get water from the rain and snow. Rain is a very pure natural source of water but snow is the purest. In some parts of the world rain is the only source of water. People have different ways of collecting it. For example in some places in Africa, people collect rain water from the roofs of houses, using pipes and store it in wells. In some parts of our own country e.g Western sudan people collect rain water in specially prepared catchment areas called Hafeers.
People also get fresh water from rivers, streams, natural lakes, natural springs and underground wells. In places where there are no sources of fresh water, people use sea water after removing the salt from it.

84

[Page 90]

What are the main water problems?

[Image of a woman pouring water from a container into a bucket.]

Water Shortage

Water shortage is the first of these problems. In many parts of the world the quantity of available water is decreasing while the demand for it is growing. For example, in the Middle East and North Africa, water is already getting scarce. Most of the major water sources such as the Jordan, the Nile, the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers are shared between two or more countries. In these countries themselves there is a growing demand for water for use in agriculture and industry.

In the Sudan there are many rural areas which suffer from permanent or seasonal shortages of water, for example the Red Sea Hills area, Kordofan and Darfur.

Water shortages are also caused by insufficient water supply and wastefulness. In some places people buy water from water sellers at higher prices than tap water. They cannot buy enough water to satisfy their domestic needs. Lack of water for washing can cause skin diseases and blindness.

In areas of plentiful water supply, e.g big cities, we find a lot of water is wasted or misused. Broken water pipes and leaks cause a lot of water loss. People also tend to use water wastefully in their homes. They water their gardens and wash their cars with good drinking water. They also leave taps running and do not repair leaks.

What causes water pollution?

85

[Page 91]

Water Pollution :

In order to have good health people must use clean and safe water. Safe drinking water is water which is free from all of the impurities that cause pollution. Water pollution causes diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, cholera, diarrhoea and many other diseases. It also kills fish and other animals which drink from it.

Water pollution is mainly caused by people's bad use of their water resource. In some countries people throw human and industrial waste into rivers and lakes. In others they throw chemicals and pesticides into streams.

Water can also get polluted from within the water supply system. For example, all over the Sudan people keep their drinking water in a water pot (zeer). It has been found that if the zeer is not cleaned and covered, the water becomes polluted and causes diseases. Also, if people use dirty containers to remove water from the zeer, the water becomes equally polluted. Some people try to avoid this problem by fixing little taps at the bottom of the zeer. Here the person can get water from the zeer without putting his hand inside it, so the water stays clean.

Water is precious; we must guard it carefully.

C. Read the text again carefully in order to answer the following questions.
1. How much of the earth's surface is covered with water?
2. Mention the uses of water.

2. How can you and your friends keep water clean and safe?
3. We, the Sudanese, waste water - our 'liquid gold':
a. Do you agree?

SAVE WATER TO MAKE THE SUDAN GREEN AND BEAUTIFUL

Section 2 : Reading II

(A) Read the following dialogue between Farid and his grandfather quickly and answer the questions.
What are they discussing?

[Image of a grandfather talking to his grandson.]

Grandfather: Listen son, I want to talk to you about something. You know, when I was a child this big empty desert around us was a big wood full of trees and bushes. Many animals and birds lived in it. There was a big natural lake in the middle which the animals drank from. I used to go with my father to hunt gazelles and rabbits and catch big birds. We used to take our catch to the village and share it with the neighbours. At that time you needed to get a permit from the local governor in order to hunt. Each hunter was allowed one gazelle, ten rabbits and ten birds per year. The people obeyed the law. We also used to collect dry branches to use as firewood. No one would cut green trees at that time. We also used to clear small plots of land around the wood and grow crops for food. We also collected fruits and seeds from the wood to eat in the dry season. We kept goats and cows for milk, too. We depended on rain water for irrigation as I used to arrange

87

[Page 93]

low stone walls, round the cultivated plots to collect rain water and reduce soil erosion. A farmer would have two or three small plots of land to use at different times. There were no food shortages. People ate very well and enjoyed beautiful natural scenery.

Farid: What happened then?
Grandfather: Some years later, some people came with big machines like tractors, bulldozers etc. and cut the trees and removed the bushes. They destroyed the whole wood. Many animals were killed and many ran away. The people were told that a certain company was planning a big agricultural scheme instead. They were promised jobs and more money. However, they were sad to lose their wood.
Some time later, the company grew some crops and sold them for export. Our people got nothing. This went on for some time until the soil became poor and the harvest became small. Also the rain decreased and drought hit the area. No more crops could be grown and the company left for another area.

[Image of a barren, dry landscape.]

The people became poorer and life in the area became difficult. Many people migrated to other areas in search of fertile fields to share with others. The new land was in turn overused and soon became equally poor.

Farid: It seems that people have caused most of the problem.
Grandfather: Yes, son, and its the people who must take responsibility for finding the solution.

B. Read the conversation again and answer these questions.
1. What was life like when grandfather was young?
2. What changed the situation later?

88

[Page 94]

3. What were the effects of that change?

C. Read this summary of a conference report and answer this question:
What was the conference about?

Conference Report

Dry land is found in most parts of the world. It affects some 900 million people. It covers nearly half of rural Africa where it affects nearly 300 million people. Many rural communities in Africa struggle to grow food and rear animals on barren land.

It was reported that in many African countries, local people and governments are introducing good programmes to fight desertification using local knowledge.

In some countries governments have distributed thousands of young trees for forestation projects. Communities, families and individuals, including children, have taken part in tree planting. Trees help to preserve the soil and provide food for the animals.

In other countries villagers have cultivated trees as cash crops. For example in Mauritania, the villagers grew palm trees and formed cooperative societies to market the dates and other products.

Another issue was the use of wood for charcoal. Governments had tried to encourage ways of cutting down the amount of charcoal used. They supplied calor gas (Buta-gas) and developed improved stoves which require less charcoal than the traditional ones.

D. Read the report again and answer the questions below.
1. How is Africa hard hit by dry land?
2. How have governments helped to solve the problems?
3. List all of the things which individuals have done to help.
4. Why is the use of charcoal a problem and how can it be solved?

E. Discussion questions:
1. What are the signs of desertification in your area?
2. What is being done to solve the problems?
3. What could your class or school do to help fight desertification?
4. Do you think the desert will be as green as it was in grandfather's day? Why? Why not?

Pollution Problems
Everyone knows that modern cities are polluted and something must be done about it. The air we breathe is not pure, the water we drink has to be purified by chlorine and our streets are full of rubbish thrown everywhere.
In the West, factories are considered to be responsible for most of the pollution. They pour out chemicals like sulphur. In many cases they also pollute rivers by pouring chemical waste into them. Many citizens add to the problem of smoke by having cars that fill the air with poisonous exhaust

A poem - "DAFFODILS"
I wandered lonely as a cloud

When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Dear Aunt Layla,
I used to enjoy my maths lessons and get good marks until this new teacher came to our school. For no reason I know of, he started picking on me from the first day he joined our school. He makes fun of me in front of the class and tries to find faults with everything I do. My friends told me that he hates me and I should try to change that. I tried hard to make things better, but he hated me more instead, and started to blame everything on me. I even got punished (many times) for things I did not do.
I can't change schools and I can't change teachers. I am thinking of leaving school altogether. Please advise me what to do???
Desperate - Rahad

Dear Desperate,
I am surprised that your teacher hates you at all and treats you like this for no reason. There must be something in your work or your behaviour that provokes him, or you may be over-sensitive. You should try to speak to him to find out why, and if you fail, tell your parents about this problem. They may be able to speak to him and solve the problem with him. DO NOT LEAVE SCHOOL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
Aunt Layla.

CHAPTER SEVEN: SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION

Section 1 : Reading 1

A. Look at these questions. Don't answer them! Think about where you might find the answers to the questions.
1. What was the temperature yesterday in Kosti at 12 p.m?
2. When is the next train from Khartoum to Karima?
3. How do you produce plastic?
4. How many men fought in the battle of Karare?
5. What should farmers be doing in their fields at the moment?

B. As we have discussed, there are many sources of information and knowledge. Now read the passage below and answer the questions.

What is meant by the mass media?

Mass Media
Most human beings have a thirst for knowledge. We want to find out what is happening, how things work, what took place in the past etc.

[Image of a man sitting in an armchair reading a newspaper, with a radio on a table and a TV in the background.]

We can get information from our own experience, our environment or from other people. We can also go to the library and read books. When information is given to a large number of people we call it the mass media which includes newspapers, magazines, radio and T.V.

99

[Page 105]

Although newspapers and magazines are very useful because you can read them again and you have time to think about the information, they can only be used by people who can read. You do not need to be able to read, however, to listen to the radio or watch T.V. Radio and T.V, therefore, are perhaps the best medium of communication with large numbers of people. In our own homes we can receive information from all over the world.

Give one advantage and one disadvantage of T.V.

T.V. has now become more popular than radio because we can both see and hear what is happening. It also provides company for the lonely and elderly and can also be good entertainment. It is lonely and elderly and can also be good entertainment it is educational because through it you can visit places which you cannot reach by yourself.

T.V. also has a number of disadvantages. It is passive entertainment because you do not take part in something but simply sit, watch and listen. If we are not careful, television can become like a thief which steals the time we would normally spend studying, taking part in sport, visiting people or enjoying our favourite hobbies. T.V. companies try to persuade us to buy videos and satellite dishes. But whether good or bad, T.V. has entered our homes and is part of our family. The mass media is here to stay.

C. Read the passage again and answer these questions.
1. What are the differences between newspapers and T.V.?
2. Make a list of a/ all of the advantages and b/ all of the disadvantages of T.V.?
3. Why might people prefer to watch T.V. rather than study?

D. Discussion questions
1. If you wanted information about the day's news would you prefer radio, T.V. or a newspaper? Why?
2. The passage said that T.V. could be like a thief which steals our time. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer.
3. What do you think is the most important section of the mass media in the Sudan? Why?

questions at the end of the test. The aim is to raise the standards of road safety.
If learners had a more thorough knowledge of the Highway Code and other road safety matters, they would be more prepared when they take to the roads by themselves.
An effective way might be to concentrate on preparing young people for driving much earlier in life. Driving and road safety education should be included as part of the school curriculum. If schools teach the youngsters how to boil an egg or join two pieces of wood, then why not teach them how a motor car works and how to drive?

Section 4 : Writing : Summary

A. 1. Read this text and answer these questions.
Why do manufacturers spend so much on advertising?
What do good looking people do?

Advertising has become a very specialised activity in modern times. In the business world of today, supply is usually greater than demand. There is great competition between the different manufacturers of the same kind of product to persuade customers to buy their own particular make. They have to regularly remind the customer of the name and the quality of their product. They do this by advertising. The manufacturer advertises in the newspaper and on posters. He sometimes pays for songs to be sung about his product on commercial radio programmes. He employs good-looking people to distribute samples of it. He organizes competitions, with prizes for the winners. He often advertises on the screens of local cinemas. Most important of all, in those countries that have television, he has advertisements put into the programmes whenever this is possible. Manufacturers often spend large sums of money on advertisements. We buy a particular product because we think that it is the best. We usually think so because the advertisements say so. Some people never try to ask themselves if the advertisements are telling the truth.

2. Now look carefully at this summary question and answer.
Summary Question: In not more than thirty words write down the main kinds of advertising included in the passage.
Answer: Producers usually advertise in newspapers and posters. Also songs, radio and T.V. programmes, and cinema screens are used. Young people are employed to distribute samples of the products.

CHAPTER EIGHT : Wildlife in the Sudan

You are now going to read about protecting wildlife in the Sudan. Before you start to read, look at the words below and say which of them are likely or unlikely to be used in the text.

meat | forest | hippo | cattle | grass
species | vegetables | game | park | snakes

Section 1 : Reading I
A. Read the passage quickly and see if you were right or wrong.

Wildlife in the Sudan

Sudan is one of the richest countries in Wildlife in Africa.
This animal wealth belongs to all the Sudanese people, and it is our duty to protect and preserve it. In the past, people were allowed to hunt animals for food. They used traditional weapons such as spears, arrows and nets. But this method of hunting did not affect the number of the animals because the amount they killed was limited. But when firearms were later introduced, specially by those hunting for commercial purposes, animals were killed in great numbers, and some species became threatened with extinction. That was why the government established the department of Wildlife, Conservation and Tourism to protect animals and arrest those who hunt without permission.

Why were Game Parks introduced?

In some parts of the Sudan, there are several game parks and forest reserves where no one may hunt and kill a wild animal. We have read already about Dinder Park in SPINE Book three. Another famous park in the Sudan where different species of animals can be found, is the Nimule National Park. It is south of Juba on the border with Uganda. It is in a savannah area with trees and grass surrounded by very high mountains.

109

[Page 115]

[Image of a waterfall in a lush, rocky landscape.]

Visitors who go to this park can see herds of elephants, rhinoceros and different types of species which they might not have seen in Dinder. They can also see beautiful scenery such as the famous Fulla Falls because the Bahr El Jebel flows through the Nimule National Park. Not far from the Falls, the visitors can go to watch the magnificent sight of the hippos swimming in the river while crocodiles lie on the sand. The guides accompanying the visitors often warn them to be on the look out for snakes which might be hanging from branches of trees or lying in the thick grass. But the snakes, like most wild animals, do not attack people unless they are disturbed.
National Parks can bring income to our country. Tourists come from various countries to the Sudan to see different species of animals which are not found in their own countries. They bring with them money in hard currency to spend while they are in the Sudan. We need this money to improve our economy.

B. Now read the passage carefully and answer the questions.
1. Why were animals not in danger in the past?
2. Why did the government establish the department of Wildlife, Conservation and Tourism?
3. What are the advantages of national parks?
4. When does a snake attack a person?
5. What do we mean by hard currency?

C. Discussion Questions
1. Which other dangerous animals not mentioned in the passage do you know of?
2. Mention the ways and the reasons animals are killed in your area?

110

[Page 116]

3. Do some people in your home keep wild animals? If so, what do they use them for?

Section 2 : Reading II
A. Read the passage quickly and answer the questions.

What are endangered species?

Endangered Species

By 'endangered species' we mean the wild animals, birds and fish whose numbers have become so small that they may disappear if people continue to kill them.

Why do people visit the Sudan Natural History Museum?

[Image of a large dinosaur skeleton.]

If you visit the Sudan Natural History Museum, you will see huge fossils of some extinct dinosaurs which were once upon a time found in the Sudan in great numbers but have completely died out. The most recent animal to disappear in the Sudan is the ariel gazelle. The last one was killed a decade ago. We shall never see that beautiful animal again except in pictures.
Today, many other kinds of wild animals in the Sudan are considered endangered species because their numbers are being reduced daily. Some of them will probably disappear like the huge dinosaurs and the beautiful ariel gazelle unless we all do something to stop it.

111

[Page 117]

Which Species are in serious danger?

The endangered species in the Sudan at present are: the white rhinoceros, the wild desert ass (addax) and the cheetah which is the fastest animal in the world. Why is this? And how can we stop this from happening? Well some things we can control and others are more difficult. Natural disasters like floods, droughts or fires, wipe out many animals. Of course, it is very difficult to prevent these. But animals also become extinct because of uncontrolled hunting. We need to enforce the law more rigidly. And we must each refuse to buy or to wear anything made from the skin or bones of these beautiful wild creatures.

B. Read the passage again carefully and answer the questions.
1. When did the most recent animal become extinct?
2. What happened to:
a) The dinosaurs?
b) The ariel gazelle?
3. Which is the fastest animal in the world?
4. How many species may disappear soon?
5. How many natural disasters have been mentioned in this passage?
6. Match the words or phrases in list A with those in list B
Examples: become extinct --- disappear

| List A. | List B. |
|---|---|
| 1. endanger | 1. threaten |
| 2. fossil | 2. last |
| 3. decade | 3. huge reptile |
| 4. most recent | 4. disappear |
| 5. dinosaur | 5. remains of an animal |
| 6. disaster | 6. types |
| 7. species | 7. ten years |
| 8. become extinct | 8. destruction |

C. Discussion Questions
1. Do you believe in the existence of dinosaurs?
Would it be good if dinosaurs were still in the Sudan?
2. Is there any animal in your area which you think should not be preserved? Why not?

112

[Page 118]

3. Do you know of any natural disaster in the Sudan which caused animals to die? Where did it take place?
4. How many animals in your area eat other animals?
5. What ways can you suggest to the class of preserving endangered species?

D. Read this notice and answer the questions.
What is the notice about?
Where might you find it?

ARE [YOU] KILLING OUR WILDLIFE?
The answer is [YES] if you buy goods made of the skins, furs, tusks or horns of certain endangered species.
Poachers are hunting these animals for a big profit at the expense of [OUR] environment.
[POACHING IS ILLEGAL]
Don't support this crime against nature. You must help the Park rangers in their attempts to prevent poachers destroying our precious animal wealth.
Let the rangers know if you see anyone or anything suspicious in the woods.
[BOYCOTT POACHERS' PRODUCTS]
Be careful when you buy shoes, handbags and ornaments. Check if they are made from the skins, horns etc. of rare species. If you stop buying, the poachers will stop hunting.
[ACT NOW] ... to protect our wildlife and to make sure our children and grandchildren can see these rare animals in their natural habitat and not just in zoos... [BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE]

113

[Page 119]

E. Read the notice again carefully and answer these questions.
1. What does a poacher do?
2. How can people prevent poaching?
3. Why, according to the notice, must people protect our wildlife?

F. Discussion questions
Role-play:
1. You are in a shop buying a present for your sister's birthday. The shopkeeper shows you a bag made of leopard skin. You try to convince him why he should not buy then re-sell these things. One pupil is the customer, the other is the shop-keeper.
2. Name some other illegal activities which endanger wildlife. What can be done to stop them?

G. 1) Read this dialogue between Man and Lion quickly.
[Image of a lion's face next to each line spoken by the lion, and a man's face for man's lines.]
We human beings have a saying that "One man's meat is another man's poison." Do you know what it means, Lion?
Does that mean there's some other meat which you don't eat because it is poisonous?
That's not the reason. It simply means that we do select what meat to eat. That's why man doesn't eat you lions, while you eat us!
Why select meat? We don't believe in that saying. Lions eat every kind of meat. Our famous saying is; "All meat is every lion's food".
That's why you are regarded as the greatest menace to the environment and peaceful co-existence among the animals because you eat them.
That's not true! You are the greatest menace to the environment. You are the one who kills animals for trade. I don't destroy forests, I don't kill fish and I don't mine minerals and pollute the environment. Yet you have got the nerve to say that we're the wild animals.

114

[Page 120]

2) Read the dialogue again carefully and answer the questions.
1. Why does man not eat every kind of meat?
2. What damages does man cause to the environment which a lion doesn't?

H. Discussion Questions
1. Which animals would people in your area not eat, but are eaten by people in other areas?
2. Who deserves to be called a wild animal in the passage? Why?
3. What are the pros and cons in this dialogue? Do you think the lion has some good points? What about the man?

Section 3 : Exploring Language

A. Working With Words
1. Phrasal verbs
In chapter seven, we found that when a common verb is followed by a preposition, an adverb or a particle, these put together will give one meaning. This is called a phrasal verb. There are many phrasal verbs in English.
Example: Some animals will die out forever.
The phrasal verb will "die out" can be replaced with one word: [disappear]
Other examples:
- The poachers always get away with their catch [escape]
- The police are looking into the crime [investigating]
- Customers will turn down the offer of illegal goods [refuse]

a) Match the verbs in list A with the words in list B to form phrasal verbs. Consult your dictionary to help you. Exchange information with your friends.
Example: run over.
| List A | List B |
|---|---|
| come | back |
| get | off on |
| run | out down |
| let | over away |
| take | in |
| push | around |

115

[Page 121]

B) Now give your partner a COMMAND or make a SUGGESTION using each of the above phrasal verbs:
Example: Don't run over people by driving too fast.

C) Fatima decided to go to El Fashir by SPINE Airways, but there was some trouble. When she arrived at Khartoum airport, she uttered the following questions quickly. Select one phrasal verb from the box and replace the words or phrases which are underlined in each sentence. The first one has been done for you.

| took off | kept on | put up |
|---|---|---|
| stop over | started out | turn back |

1. Our plane left on time for El Fasher ----- took off
2. We began our trip early in the morning ........................
3. We intended to interrupt our trip in El Obeid ..................
4. There was a sandstorm but the plane continued flying ..............
5. After that the pilot decided to return to Khartoum .................
6. Some of us were accommodated in the airport hotel .............

2. Spelling Practice
a) Words ending in -ful
The word 'Full' by itself has a double 'l' at the end.
Example: The forest is full of wild animals.

When we want to write a sentence containing two ideas that do not go together, but are in contrast to each other we use: although / though / even if / even though. They are called clauses of concession.

Look at these statements about stubborn people!
a) I will take the bicycle, although my father told me not to.
b) Though the bus looks dangerous, the driver will continue the journey.
c) I shall buy a car, even though it is expensive.
d) The pilot will take off, even if there is a sandstorm.

| | although | they know it is forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| Poachers kill animals illegally | though | it tastes nice |
| Many girls don't like it | even though | it is far north |
| It rains heavily in Dongola | even if | he was carelessly dressed |
| He got the job | | there is a storm |
| We must leave | | |

3. Use although/ though/ even if to connect the following sentences.
a) Gold is expensive. Lots of women still buy it.

Section 4 : Writing Task

A. Read This
Summaries in Daily Life.
Making a summary is easy. We use it in our daily life when we are talking. We do not always give all the details of everything we say.

1. Read these examples:
a) Last month, Peter visited Nimule National Park. When he returned home, a friend asked him about his visit. Peter replied, "It was very good and exciting. I saw various animals and beautiful scenery."
b) A cousin has just arrived from Gadaref. His uncle wants to know about the summer season there. The cousin may reply: "The rains are heavy. People expect a good harvest."
c) You saw a traffic accident. A police officer asked you what happened. Instead of giving all the details, you reply: "The lorry swerved to avoid a pedestrian. It ran into a van coming from the opposite direction."

2. Now give a short summary of following:
a) Your brother returned from the school after he had sat for the Sudan School Certificate exams. You asked him how he found the examination, he replied: "___________________________"
b) A friend has just bought a new watch. You are interested in buying the same kind of watch yourself. So you asked your friend for his opinion. He replied "___________________________________"

[Image of a person riding an elephant.]
Ahmed has been staying in India for the last six months. He went there to study science in the University of Bombay. Ahmed has written a long letter to his parents recently. He described his visit to a great number of different places in India. One of the places he was taken to by a friend of his was the Bombay Zoo. There he was made to ride on an elephant for the first time. He was very frightened because he has never ridden an elephant in the Sudan. Of course elephants in the Sudan are never ridden by people. Ahmed has now become used to riding elephants, so he is finding his stay in India very exciting.

CHAPTER NINE: Entertainment

Section 1: Reading 1

A) The following passage is an extract from the novel 'The Wedding of Zein' written by the Sudanese writer, Tayeb Salih.
Read the passage quickly to answer this question:
What happened to the headmaster and to Sheikh Ali when they were told about Zein's wedding?

[Image of an older man talking to a younger boy holding a jug.]

'Have you heard the news? Zein is getting married', said Haleema, the seller of milk, to Amna, who had as usual called before sunrise, as she measured her out a piastre's worth.
The jug all but fell from Amna's hands and Haleema, profiting by her preoccupation, gave her short measure.
At noon the courtyard of the Intermediate School was quiet and deserted, the students having gone to their classes. From afar there appeared a young boy hurrying along breathlessly, the end of his outer garment tucked under his arm, till he came to a stop in front of the door of 'the second year', the Headmaster's form.
'You ass of a boy, what's made you so late?'
A look of cunning flashed momentarily in Tureifi's eyes.

125

[Page 131]

'Sir, have you heard the news?'
'News about what, you animal of a boy?'
The Headmaster's anger, however, did not shake the boy's composure. Checking his laughter, he said: 'They're marrying off Zein the day after tomorrow.'
The Headmaster's lower jaw dropped in astonishment and Tureifi escaped punishment.
And in the market Abdul Samad advanced towards Sheikh Ali's shop, his face flushed, leaving it in no doubt that he was in an angry frame of mind. There was a debt owing to him from Sheikh Ali, the tobacco dealer, which the latter had put off paying for a whole month. He was determined to have it settled that very day by hook or by crook.
'Ali, do you really think you'll do me out of my money, or what is it you've got in mind?'
'Hajj Abdul Samad, just put your trust in God and sit down and have a cup of coffee with us.'
'To hell with your coffee. Get up and open this safe of yours and give me my money. If you're determined not to pay, just say so.
Sheikh Ali spat the tobacco from his mouth.
'Come along and sit down and I'll tell you a bit of news.'
'I've not got the time, neither for you nor for your bit of news. I know well enough that you're trying to fool me and talk me out of my money.'
'I swear your money's here safe and sound. Come along and sit down and I'll tell you the story of Zein's marriage.'
'Whose marriage did you say?'
Zein's marriage.
Abdul Samad seated himself and, placing both hands on top of his head, remained silent for a while. Sheikh Ali regarded him, delighted with the effect he had produced. Eventually Abdul Samad found his tongue.
'Ah, there's no god but God and Mohammed is the Prophet of God. By the Prophet himself, Sheikh Ali, what sort of story's that?'
Abdul Samad did not settle his debt that day.

Section 2 : Reading II
A. Read the following passage quickly and answer this question:

What do people do to help themselves relax?

In the Sudan people go to work for six days a week. They work hard from the early morning till late in the afternoon. In the evenings some people might still have to do more work, while others might have many social obligations to fulfil. Being so busy is often very tiring; a person needs some entertainment in order to relax. Therefore, different people go to different places of interest.

In big towns people go to parks, theatres, cinemas or they might prefer to stay at home and watch T.V. All round rural areas in the country, in different villages people might gather at the weekends to entertain themselves by dancing, wrestling, racing and many other exciting activities.

[Image of a group of young men and women standing in a circle under a crescent moon.]

In a northern Kordofan village you see young men and ladies in the moonlight standing in big circles singing, dancing and playing games. Children also play and enjoy the night in their own fashion.
However, one of the most entertaining activities for young men all over the Sudan is watching football matches. It is no wonder that many young people such as school boys, dedicate a lot of money and time to this hobby. As for young girls, wedding parties are generally more favoured than sports games.

William Shakespeare (1564-1616)
[Image of William Shakespeare.]

William Shakespeare was born at Stratford-upon-Avon on the 23rd of April and died (after many years!) on the same date. He went to Stratford Grammar School where he received a free education because of his father's position in the town.
Shakespeare started his life as a schoolmaster in the country but soon he moved to London as an actor and playwright. In London he became very famous with his great plays. In fact, he wrote many of the greatest dramatic masterpieces in English literature.
Some of Shakespearean's plays were tragedies such as 'Hamlet' and 'Richard II'; while others were comedies like 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' and 'As You Like It'. All the plays he wrote were performed in the Globe Theatre and were printed later or even after his death.
His plays have been translated into many different languages. They have inspired many poets, dramatists, film-makers and many other creative artists. They have formed the basis of the English theatre.
Some critics said, 'He was not of an age but for all times'. Another

129

[Page 135]

critic compared him to Socrates. A third one called him 'Sweet swan of Avon'.
William Shakespeare was certainly the world's greatest dramatist. But was he really Shakespeare or Sheikh el-Zubier?!

Now read it again and answer these questions:
1. How old was Shakespeare when he died?
2. Give two pieces of information from the passage which show that he is famous.

CHAPTER TEN : Modern Technology

Section 1: Reading 1

The twentieth century has seen many advances in technology and here we look at two recent developments which both involve INFORMATION.
A) Read the following passage quickly and answer the questions:
1. What makes satellites seem to stand still?
2. Where do satellites receive signals from?

SATELLITES AND COMPUTERS
[Image of a satellite.]
Satellites are space stations sent into orbit round the earth. One major use of satellites is for communications using telephone, radio and T.V. signals. We call these "Communication satellites". They are sent into orbit thousands of kilometres away from the earth and they allow information to be sent and received all round the world. They seem to be fixed to the spot, because they make a complete circle round the earth in 24 hours.

A satellite receives signals sent to it from a station on earth and returns it at a very high frequency. On the earth this frequency is tracked by the antennae of the ground stations. The signals can also be sent to and received from ships at sea. It is strange to think that all around us people are 'talking' to each other and we don't hear them!
[Image of a large satellite dish.]

Why can a satellite now provide more telephone circuits?

One of the world's first satellites, called Early Bird, was launched over the Atlantic ocean in 1965 when there

were only five stations to make use of the 66 telephone circuits it offered. Today there are several satellites on that part of the globe. They offer more than 25,000 two-way telephone circuits in addition to the many one-way T.V. channels they provide. This is because earth stations have greatly increased in number.

What's the name of the satellite used in the Middle East?

The world's first regional satellite system was the Indonesian 'Palapa'. It was originally designed to support communications in the 1,800 inhabited islands of the country but later also served neighbouring countries. Another regional satellite system in service now is ARABSAT which is used by countries in the Middle East.

B) Before you continue: Answer these questions:
1. What is a satellite?
2. What does it do?
3. How far into space are satellites placed?
4. What do earth stations use to track signals?
5. What are 'Palapa' and 'ARABSAT'?

C) Now, read about information technology and answer the question:

What is information technology?

Nowadays information is gathered, up-dated and stored using electronic means. This is called INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT).

[Image of a person using an old desktop computer.]

Information can be in the form of words, (your book is a good example), numbers, music, or pictures
A computerised picture is a picture which exists as points of light on a

140

[Page 146]

television screen. These points can be changed easily and quickly. This means that even a photograph which is usually fixed and unchangeable can be changed in different ways such as its size, shape, and colour. You can do the same with words and numbers.

What can you learn with information technology?

Information technology can improve your learning. At the beginning, educational computer programmes were devised so that a pupil could respond to questions set out by a certain programme. If he responded correctly, the pupil could be rewarded with another set of questions. This kind of programme tended to be linked with one subject. However, as the computer has developed, the pupils can have different programmes not limited to one project. Moreover, you can use the technology to improve your own work or your friend's work. Another good example is that the computer can correct your spelling mistakes and change your work as many times as you wish till you reach the standard you want. Some people have even suggested that computers like this could eventually replace teachers. How do you like that idea?!

D) Read about information technology again and answer the following questions:
1. Information can be stored in a computer in the form of words, numbers, music and pictures only. Is this true or false? How can you tell?
2. What helps to enlarge or reduce information stored in a computer?
3. What is the difference between old and modern computers?

E) Discussion Questions:
1. What are the fields in which computers are used in the Sudan?
2. Do you believe that computers really can replace teachers? Why? Why not?
3. Mention other uses of computers which you think are important to the Sudan as a developing country.
4. If your school was given a computer, what could it be used for?

141

[Page 147]

E) Match a picture with an object from column A and a function from column B

| A | B |
|---|---|
| a. Computer | 1. broadcasts radio programmes accompanied with pictures |
| b. Satellite | 2. can solve a mathematical problem in a very short time. |
| c. Video | 3. receives and sends signals to earth. |
| d. T.V. | 4. can record T.V. programmes and play them later. |
| e. Earth station | 5. used by people at home to receive distant programmes. |
| f. Dish | 6. sends and receives signals from satellites |
| g. Calculator | 7. enables man to move a heavy object |

Section 2 : Reading 2

A. Read the passage below and answer the question:

Why does the passage talk about trees and teeth?

The story of the wheel is a good illustration of how man's creativity and imagination are used to invent new devices. It also shows he has changed and adapted existing machines to meet man's needs and fulfil his dreams and plans.
The wheel is not a recent technological development. It is, of course, thousands of years old. The idea, like most of man's 'inventions' came from nature. Before the invention of the wheel tree trunks were used as large rollers to move big blocks of stones and so the wheel was born. As people used these rollers, they came to see their possibilities - what other things they could be used for. They also discovered their limitations - what the

142

[Page 148]

rollers could not do. The need to overcome these limitations led to change and adaptation.
This process of change led eventually to the wheel and axle. The wheel has the same round shape as the tree trunk. The wheel turns around a fixed axle which is usually a bar of wood or metal. The wheel and axle made it easier for the vehicle to move in different directions. The axle could also be fastened to a cart to carry things.

[Image of an old car, a very early automobile, and a motorcycle with a sidecar.]

The gear-wheel came later. It is a wheel with teeth! One wheel is linked with another one.
[Image of a bicycle.]
When one wheel turns, another wheel or many other wheels move.
This can be observed in machines such as clocks, sewing machines, video recorders and bioycles.
The bicycle, for example, consists of two (or more) gear wheels which, in turn, propel the larger wheels which move along the road. When a cyclist turns the pedal one complete circle, the bicycle travels a distance of about 18 feet.
Technology has continued to improve the shape and use of the wheel. Do you think the wheel itself will ever be replaced?

B) Read the passage again in order to answer the following questions:
1. How long ago was the wheel invented?

143

[Page 149]

2. Why was : a- the wheel and axle better than trees? b- the gear-wheel better than the wheel and axle?
3. Give examples of uses of the gear-wheel.
4. According to the passage, why do people keep making changes to the things they invent?
5. Match the following words from the passage with those in the box below:
weaknesses, not proud, example, push forward
seen, substituted, fixed, machines, made suitable, modern
a. illustration : (paragraph 1)
b. devices : (para 1)
c. adapted : (para 1)
d. limitations : (para 2)
e. recent : (para 2)
f. fastened : (para 3)
g. observed : (para 5)
h. propel : (para 6)
i. replaced : (para 7)
j. humble : (title)
6. Write these phrases from the passage in your own words:
a. fulfil his dreams (para 1)
b. they discovered their limitations (para 2)
c. (the wheel) was born (para 2)
d. move in different directions (para 3)
e. will not be replaced (para 7)

C) Discussion Questions:
1. Think of as many machines as you can that depend on some kind of wheel.
2. "Most men's inventions are imitations of nature". Can you think of examples of such inventions?
3. Modern technology is both helpful and harmful. Do you agree? Give examples.

Reading 3
Tom Brown's School Days is a novel which describes the early life of the book's hero - Tom Brown. In this extract Tom and his friends Tadpole and East are returning to the school after completing a cross-country run.

The extract begins when they hear Tadpole shouting for help.

A) Read the extract to answer these questions:
1. How were the boys feeling before they reached the school?
2. Who went first into the Doctor's office?

[Image of three schoolboys, one looking very muddy and tired.]

They heard a cry from the next field. They answered it. Then over a gate about twenty yards away came poor Tadpole. He was almost dead with tiredness. He had lost a shoe in the stream. He was wet and as sad as a boy could be. Then the three went on and on along the never-ending lane. At last the lane led them to a road, and along the road came a coach. The boys climbed up behind the coach and sat there, shaking with cold. East fell off and went flat on his face on the road. Then he climbed up again. They reached Rugby about forty minutes after the gates were locked.
They went into the school through the servants' door. They met old Thomas, the man who was in charge of the gates. He stopped.
"Ah! " he said. "Three boys late for locking up! You must go to the Doctor's room at once. "
"Can't we go and wash first? "
"No, you must go straight to the Doctor's room", said Thomas.
They went up the stairs.
"Who shall go in first?" asked Tadpole.
"You," said East. "You are the eldest. "
"No," said Tadpole. "Look at the state in which I am -- covered with dirt. "
"Well, look at me," said East, "I am as dirty as you are. --- Here, Brown, you are the cleanest. You must go first. There is the door."
East pushed Tom forward. The sound of happy voices and laughter came from inside. Tom knocked. The Doctor's voice said "Come in". He opened the door and they went into the room. The Doctor was making a boat. Round him stood three boys or four children. The Doctor looked at the three boys standing in front of him.

145

[Page 151]

"Well, run upstairs and get some clean things, and tell the cook to give you some tea. Good night."
"Good night, sir."
The three boys ran away.
"That was very nice of him," said Tadpole. "He did not give us any Latin to learn for being late, and his cook will give us a much better tea than we should get in the School Hall."

B) Read the passage again and answer the following questions:
1. Why was Tadpole unhappy?

[Image of Helen Keller.]
A. Read the first part of the passage quickly and say what was special about Helen Keller.

Helen Keller

Helen Keller was an American author and lecturer who was able to overcome great physical hardships. She suffered a serious illness and she became blind, deaf and dumb before she was two years old. However, she did not give up hope. She struggled very hard in order to live an active and useful life.
In her first book, 'The Story of My Life', she tells us of her early childhood which was at first gloomy and sad. She was desperate until something happened which completely changed her life. The third of March 1887 was a day which she would remember for a long time.

Can you guess what happened on that day?

It marked a turning point in her life because on that day she met her teacher and guide, Miss Sulivan, for the first time. Like Helen, Miss Sulivan herself had lost her sense of sight when she was young, but she later recovered it. She was perhaps the best person to understand the problems of those who were blind. She volunteered to stand by Helen and take care of her education.

Why was Miss Sulivan a good teacher?

154

[Page 160]

She was a very loving and affectionate friend who spared no effort in teaching her how to spell simple words. Miss Sulivan worked patiently, step by step. She would put an object like a doll in Helen's hand. Helen would then feel the object and write the letters on her own hand over and over again. She then moved on to reading words written in small squares with raised letters. She learnt that every word has special meaning. Every day she improved, until finally she was able to read books written in Braille.

[Image of a braille alphabet chart and hands reading braille.]

In 1888 Helen travelled to Boston with her mother and her teacher. There she joined a special institute for the blind. She soon developed feelings of happiness and security, finding herself amongst children of her own age who were also blind. Helen now had only one problem which she had to solve. She could no longer bear to remain silent and communicate with people only by making signs or by writing. She wanted to make sounds. Before she became blind and deaf she had been able to speak but she had eventually lost this ability. Learning to speak was not impossible for a person like Helen with strong will power and determination.

Can you guess how Helen learnt to speak?
(Remember how she learnt to read and write)

Her first efforts at learning to speak were by feeling with her fingers the movements of her own and her mother's lips and throat. In a very short time she was able to say the six basic sounds: M P A S T I.
It was her ambition now to study at Radcliffe University. She sat the entrance exam with other students who were neither blind nor deaf. To her great joy, she passed. As well as English, she studied many foreign languages such as Latin, French and German. During her four years of study at the university she did not ignore her talents and creative imagination.

155

[Page 161]

B) Read the passage again carefully and answer these questions.
1. Make a list of the things which Helen was able to do despite her blindness.
2. How did she communicate with people?
3. Describe Helen's character.
4. In what ways did a) her mother and b) her teacher help her?
5. Why was Helen's life difficult?

C) Discussion questions.
1. Do you know anyone who is blind, deaf or physically handicapped? How are you and others able to help him or her?
2. What services are provided in your area to help handicapped people?
3. What, in your opinion, was Helen's greatest achievement? Give reasons for your answer.

Section 2 : Reading II
(A) Look at this picture.
- Who is this man?
- Why is he famous?
[Image of Taha Hussein.]
Ali Ahmed has just written a biography of the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein. John from Radio Spine is interviewing him.

(B) Now read the interview and answer the questions below.
John: Could you fell us about Taha Hussein's early life?
Ali: Yes, he tells us a lot about it in his book "The Stream of Days". He lost his sight when he was a baby, but he had a good family to help him. His parents and his twelve brothers and sisters treated him in a special way and tried to make life easy for him.
John: How did he feel about this 'special treatment'?
Ali: At first, of course, he was puzzled by it, but he soon realised the reason for their special kindness. He soon discovered that his brothers and sisters could do things and describe things

156

[Page 162]

that he could not. At first he felt angry and jealous, but his anger soon turned to deep sadness.
John: That's very understandable. It must have been terrible. But he didn't just give in, did he?
Ali: No, far from it. At a very early age he showed himself to be a person with strong will power who was able to overcome his blindness and lead an active and useful life. He was curious and eager for knowledge. He also had a creative imagination and a talent for learning.
[Image of two men talking at a desk.]
John: Yes. Tell us some of his achievements.
Ali: He went to the local school (Al Kutab) in his village and before he was seven he could recite the Holy Quran. In 1902 he travelled to Cairo and studied at Al Azhar. He then joined the university and got post graduate degrees. He was later sent to study at the Sorbonne University in Paris where he was awarded a doctorate degree.
John: Quite a man! Thank you for talking to us, Mr. Ahmed. I'm sure many people will want to read your book.

A. Questions
1. When did Taha Hussein go blind?
2. What showed us that he was a determined person?
3. Why do you think 1902 was a turning point in his life?
4. How do we know that Taha was very intelligent?

C. English Lessons !
A father wanted his son, Mohamed, to learn English perfectly, so he sent him to school. After a year, Mohamed could say very little in English. Mohamed's father then sent him to a small village in England. He thought that if he heard only English, he would speak it perfectly. After a year, the father went to see Mohamed in England. He took a taxi from Heathrow airport to the village where Mohamed had been living. When the English boys saw the man dressed in a jallabiya and 'Imma', they ran up and cried excitedly, "Abu Mohamed Ja!"

The countries of the world often find it difficult to agree with each other! However, in international sporting events, people try to forget the things which divide them. They come together to enjoy competing with each other. The World Cup and the Olympic games are the most famous international sporting events.

A. Read the following passage quickly and answer the questions:
What could the winning team do with the cup?

A Great Match : World Cup Final 1970

The date was Sunday June 21st 1970. The place was the Aztec Stadium in Mexico City. 130,000 people can sit in this stadium and on that Sunday it was completely full of spectators. There were also 2,500 journalists, radio and television men, all waiting to send back news of the match to countries throughout the world.
This was football's most important match. It was the World Cup Final between two teams that love to play good football - Brazil and Italy. Both countries had won the World Cup twice before. Brazil in 1958 and 1962, Italy in 1934 and 1938. If a country wins the competition three times, they keep the cup for ever. No one had done this since the World Cup competition began in 1930. Now the whole world waited to see whether Brazil or Italy would take the cup home with them.

Who took the Italian free-kick?

The game began quickly. Riva of Italy took the ball and dribbled up into the Brazilian defence. Twenty-five yards from the goal, he kicked the ball hard and low at the Brazilian goal.
Felix, the Brazilian goalkeeper, had to move fast to stop the ball. Riva's speed surprised the Brazilian backs. Soon he had the ball

167

[Page 173]

again. Riva kicked the ball hard at the Brazilian goal and Felix made a difficult save. A few moments later, Italy were given a free-kick.
The crowd became quiet as Mazzola took the kick. The ball flew in front of the Brazilian goal and again Riva was waiting for it. He jumped and headed the ball. The ball went just over the corner of the Brazilian goal-post.

How did Pele get the ball?

Brazil were playing more slowly than the Italians. But things changed quickly. The Brazilian team began to attack. Rivelino dribbled the ball down the left side of the pitch and Pele ran with him down the centre of the field. A very good pass by Rivelino carried the ball across from the left towards the Italian goal. Pele was there. He jumped high and strongly headed the ball into the back of the goal. The Brazilian spectators roared with happiness. Brazil had scored the first goal of the final.

How many goals were scored in the first half?

Italy needed a goal to equal the score. Eight minutes before half-time, they succeeded.
A Brazilian back lazily passed the ball back towards his goalkeeper, Felix. But it was a bad pass. Felix was too far away to reach the ball. He ran towards the ball from the edge of the penalty area. But Boninsegna of Italy reached the ball first. Calmly, he dribbled it past Felix and kicked the ball into an open goal.
So, at half-time, the score was Brazil-1, Italy-1

Did the goalkeeper make a mistake?

Three minutes after the second half began, Pele nearly scored again. He jumped in the air and headed the ball towards the goal. The crowd roared as they saw the chance of another goal by Pele. The ball flew off Pele's head and past the Italian goal. He missed a goal by a few inches.
Brazil now looked the better team. Their players were working well together and passing the ball forwards. Several fouls by the Italians now gave Brazil a large number of free kicks. Rivelino nearly scored from a free kick, as the ball hit hard against the post of the Italian goal. The Italian backs looked worried. The Brazilian forwards looked dangerous.
Jairzinho was now playing well for Brazil. He moved forward quickly and passed the ball to Gerson. Gerson found an open space and he kicked a

168

[Page 174]

long hard shot at the Italian goal. No goalkeeper in the world could have stopped that ball.
The Brazilian supporters roared again. The score was 2-1 to Brazil.

Who scored the last goal of the match?

The Italians kicked off again. But Brazil were now looking for more goals and a few minutes later, Gerson kicked the ball across the front of the Italian goal. Pele was waiting as usual in the middle. He headed the ball down to the feet of Jairzinho. All Jairzinho had to do was to kick the ball into the Italian goal. In fact, Jairzinho did not kick the ball properly but it made no difference. It was another goal and Brazil were winning 3-1.
Only twenty minutes of the match remained. Italy brought on two substitutes to give the team new strength.
The last goal came three minutes before the end of the game.
Again, it was Brazil who scored. Pele passed the ball across to Alberto and Alberto kicked the ball into the goal. And that was that. The result was certain. Brazil had won the 1970 World Cup by four goals to one.

Section 2: Reading 1
A) Read the passage and answer the questions that follow it.

Faster and Faster

Tony Simmons of Great Britain won the 5,000 metre race at a recent international meeting. He is not Britain's best runner. There are others who did not take part in this race because they were training for the Olympic Games. However, if Simmons had run at this speed before 1966, he would have broken a world record. And if the unbeatable Paavo Nurmi had run in the same race at the speed which won him his world record in 1924, he would have been a minute and seven seconds behind; Simmons would have lapped him.

[Image of a long distance race in progress on a road.]

World records in all athletic events are broken, and although no one can imagine that they won't be broken, we wonder why it should happen. All that is involved in running is a courageous, trained athlete, a pair of shoes and a track. Tracks are now better than they used to be, but this improvement in running times can hardly be attributed to technological changes.
Whatever the changes are, they are not improvements in the efficiency of movement. Those who run a lot develop the style that is efficient for them. It is better training that produces the best results.
A good example of this is to be found in middle-distance running. This has greatly improved since Ethiopians and other East Africans began to take part in international athletics. They run and train at altitude and so their systems are adapted to getting oxygen from the thin air of the mountains. For this reason, they are very good at getting oxygen when they compete at normal heights. Now most distance runners have begun to include altitude training in their preparations for competitions.

Wet hair clinging to my face
Water running in my eyes
Sun-warmth close on my cheeks
Myself alive, light
Shaking hair out of my eyes
And water
Off my nose and cheeks
And seeing the world.

Susan decided that her wedding party should be a small U.N Conference. She invited people of different nationalities. There were six Chinese, three Japanese, four British, two French, five Saudis, ! She served Indian food and Sudanese drinks and they all danced to European music!
Be careful.
When you are making nouns and adjectives of nationality, remember that they have different endings. They could end in e.g. (-ese), (-ch), (-ish), (-ian), (-an) or (-i). (There are some other possibilities)

Practice
(1) These things are found in the Duty Free Shop in Khartoum. They come from different countries. Make adjectives from the names of the countries in the box below to describe them.

172

__________ watches
__________ perfume
__________ books

(2) Now add things from other countries to the duty free shop.

(3) Listen to your teacher read this dialogue. What do you notice about the teacher's voice?
Father: What are you doing here?
Son: I'm looking for the pen.
Father: Whose pen?
Son: Mine. The one I borrowed from you.
Father: My good Parker pen? Where is it? Who took it? Why are you so careless?
Father, don't get angry. I'll find it.

(4) Listen to these words and listen to your teacher say them. What do you notice about them?
Know | listen | lamb

1. However.
Read about these people:
1. Tarig is a rich man; however he doesn't like to spend money.
2. Waleed works from morning until night; however he still spends a lot of time with his family.
Notice the word 'however' is used to show contrast:
A rich man ___ does not spend money
A busy man ___ spends time with his family.
* Use 'however' and complete the sentences with an appropriate ending. Ahmed is telling his friend Omer about their arrangements to go to Darfur:
You can go to El Fasher by lorry; however __________, you can take the plane.
Talha is busy; however __________. He has directed his driver to take us to EL Fasher.
By the way, the car will travel very fast, however, __________.
2. 'Therefore'
is often used to introduce a clause of reason.
Example: It was impossible to see the ball, therefore they stopped playing.

Now, join the two sentences using 'therefore'.
a) 1. The best player missed the game.
2. The team was beaten.
b) 1. He was injured in the last game.
2. He couldn't play the final match.

C. Time For Tenses
Sequence of tenses

Read this and say which sport is being described.
In the last match Gollera scored three goals in one half of the game. He shot the first one from a distance of 20 yards. The goalkeeper was alert but he failed to catch the ball.

At 4.30 the game started and there was a lot of shouting and excitement. The police tried to keep order, but nobody was listening. When the first goal was scored, there was even more excitement, chanting and drumming. Some fans waved their turbans and others waved burning newspapers. Five minutes before the end of the match, the second goal was scored and the whole place was turned upside down. The fans pushed their way onto the field and attacked the referee and the players.

It was only the second time in my life to go to a football stadium to watch a game live. We reached the stadium at three in the afternoon and it was very hot and dusty. Hundreds of people were trying to push their way through. We could hardly see the field or find a place to sit.
