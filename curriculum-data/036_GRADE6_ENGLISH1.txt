Introduction
More than 20 years have passed since the publication of SPINE, the current
English curriculum taught at basic and secondary stages in Sudan. Since the
publication of SPINE, a lot has changed in terms of methodologies, learning
trends and educational guidelines.
This new English language curriculum, SMILE (Sudan Modern Integrated
Learning of English), is specially tailored to Sudanese pupils in general
education and it is intended to replace the SPINE Curriculum. It is a response
to the decision made at the 2012 Educational Policy Conference to introduce
Sudanese pupils to the English language earlier to improve the English
language standard in Sudan.
The Federal Ministry of Education and the NCCER-Bakhter-Ruda in
partnership with the World Bank Basic Education Recovery Project (BERP)
and in collaboration with the British Council in Khartoum, worked to
produce the SMILE Curriculum.
The SMILE Curriculum is the result of collective work done by national and
international material writers, consultants, special advisors and artists, all
under the supervision and administration of the NCCER.
The introduction of English language learning in the basic level grades aims
to prepare Sudanese pupils to participate productively in the 21st century.
Pupils will become aware of the significance of English as an international
means of knowledge and communication.
The SMILE series is comprised of the following components:

A Pupil's Book.

An Activity Book.

A Teacher's Book.

CD/ Mp3s.

Posters/ Flashcards.
The SMILE series is a pupil-centred, standards-based curriculum. It targets
phonics and makes use of cross-curricular topics and enjoyable learning
activities to motivate younger learners. Both print and cursive handwriting
III
==End page 4==
==Start page 5==
are introduced from the very beginning of the course. The SMILE Curriculum
intends to develop a positive attitude towards English as a foreign language
and teaches the four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing)
simultaneously.
The SMILE Curriculum adopts communicative approaches for teaching
English as a foreign language at the basic level in Sudan. Communicative
mechanisms such as Total Physical Response (TPR), storytelling, guessing
games, roleplays, body language, problem solving drills, spelling practice,
phonic drills and the incorporation of cross-curricular material ensure that
pupils are exposed to many ways to practise English communicatively.
The SMILE Curriculum's evaluation and assessment methods utilise both
formative and summative approaches. At all levels, assessment emphasises
the achievement of both standards and their indicators for each grade, aiming
to attain and guarantee a high quality assurance curriculum and to confirm a
High Stake Standards Benchmark (HSSB) syllabus. Moreover, at all levels,
a cross-curricular dimension that also includes life skills, morals, traditions
and values has been incorporated thoroughly into the content of the syllabus;
adding relevance and cohesion with the rest of the basic level curricula
subjects.
By the end of the basic level at grade 9 pupils should:

have developed a positive attitude towards the English language.

have participated in enjoyable pupil-centred learning, which employs the
use of interactive drills, simple stories, rhymes, chants, language games,
phonic activities, arts, project work and integrated language skills
development.

have built their confidence and self-esteem through active use of the
language.

have acquired a strong foundation for the four linguistic skills: listening,
speaking, reading and writing.

be able to understand, reply to and participate in dialogues, roleplays
and interviews using a variety of lexical sets and formulaic expressions.

be able to read and write a variety of different text types for a variety of
purposes suitable to their age group.
IV
==End page 5==
==Start page 6==

have developed various life skills, including critical thinking, problem
solving and decision making.

have received positive input about their own Sudanese culture and that
of English speaking countries.

have raised their awareness about the diversity of cultures within Sudan.

have developed cross-curricular skills.

be able to read and understand national and international supplementary
readers in later grades.

have received inclusive teaching and encouragement regardless of
linguistic aptitude and performance through the use of special educational
teaching strategies.

have been exposed to examples of modern technology.

have achieved level B1 of the Common European Framework (CEF).
SMILE textbooks consist of twelve units which follow a consistent format:
every unit has eight lessons. Lesson 8 is always a revision of the previous
lessons of the unit. Most units include two recordings; these are of dialogues,
chants and/or stories. Most units also include a story. Unit 12 revises learning
from previous units, while for Books 2 – 7, Unit 1 consolidates learning from
the previous year's book.
We hope that the SMILE Curriculum will be accessible to pupils, teachers,
supervisors and parents.
With best regards,
Dr Hamdan Ahmed Hamdan Abuanja
Head of the English Language Department – NCCER
Bakht-er-Rudha, November 2016.

Lesson 2
25,000 years ago, people lived in caves. About this time, they started to count.
They drew symbols on the walls of the caves to help them.
5,000 years ago, Sudanese and Egyptian people built pyramids. They used
Maths and numbers to calculate how to build them.
2,000 years ago, the Indians invented a symbol for zero.
1,000 years ago, the Arabs invented new symbols for numbers one to nine. We
use these symbols around the world today.
• 500 years ago, Europeans invented the symbols for plus (+) and minus (-).
80 years ago, Europeans and Americans invented computers. Computers use
only two numbers, 1 (on) and 0 (off), to make the other numbers, pictures,
letters and words.
